<h2><span class="small">Acknowledgments</span></h2>
<p>The research on early Black Hills and Badlands history
was ably assisted by Miss June Carothers,
whose services were provided the author through a
generous grant-in-aid by the University of Denver&rsquo;s
Bureau of Humanities and Social Development.</p>
<p>Miss Ina T. Aulls, Mrs. Alys Freeze, Mrs. Opal
Harber, Miss Margery Bedinger, Mrs. Margaret
Simonds, Mrs. Elizabeth Kingston, and Mrs. Clara
Cutright, all of the Denver Public Library, are particularly
to be thanked for placing the resources of
that institution at my disposal.</p>
<p>For assistance in preparing the manuscript, I wish
to thank Miss Helen Kiamos, Miss Edith Goldfarb,
and Miss Lillian Helling.</p>
<p>I am indebted to Bell Photo of Rapid City for the
photograph of the Needles highway; to Ned Perrigoue
of Rapid City for that of Sylvan Lake; to the
Denver Public Library Western Collection for those
of Calamity Jane, Wild Bill Hickok, and Deadwood
Gulch in 1881; and to Mr. A. H. Pankow of the
South Dakota State Highway Commission for that
of a Black Hills stream.</p>
<p>And finally, as always, thanks go to my wife, Ann,
for her patient editorial help.</p>

<h2><span class="small">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>I have had an opportunity to enjoy one of the
most readable accounts of the Black Hills I
have ever come across. It is written to acquaint
traveling America with an area which was long
off the beaten path of tourists, and which has
only during the past quarter century been recognized
as a place where people who wish to
&ldquo;Know America First&rdquo; may profitably spend
some time.</p>
<p>Mr. Williams has outlined the historical reason
why this small wonderland was so long outside
the consciousness of America, and he has
devoted a chapter to telling about the methods
of nature in producing the intricacies of this
formation, older by far than the Alps or the
Himalayas. He has made the subject live, and
he includes enough expert terminology to
satisfy the reader that he knows whereof he
speaks.</p>
<p>In his chapter on &ldquo;The Hills Today&rdquo; Mr.
Williams outlines what the tourist should see,
and how to see it. For that chapter alone his
book would be well worth the attention of
<span class="pb" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
every prospective sight-seer. He has two chapters
pertaining to the history of the region, the
first speculating on how the whole economic
growth of the West might well have been
altered had a confirmed story of &ldquo;gold in the
Black Hills&rdquo; been released fifty years before
it was spread-eagled on the pages of the <i>Chicago
Inter-Ocean</i>. It is an interesting speculation,
and he gives it a pleasing reality.</p>
<p>Another chapter deals with the lives of some
of the characters exploited and given semi-permanent
fame by the old dime novels. Deadwood
without these characters would be just
another picturesque town set down in a mountain
valley; with them it becomes one of America&rsquo;s
better-known hot spots, vying with the
Klondike and Leadville.</p>
<p>Mr. Williams&rsquo; last chapter on the Badlands,
a neighboring phenomenon, a place of amazing
mystery and strange disorder, serves to depict
what might be termed the undepictable in
terms exactly calculated to excite the reader&rsquo;s
absorbed interest.</p>

<br />The Black Hills:
<br />The Forbidden Land</h2>
<p>The thing to remember is that the Black
Hills are not hills at all. They are mountains,
the highest mountains east of the Rockies,
with Harney Peak rising to a height of
7,242 feet above sea level. Inasmuch as the
prairie floor averages, at the four entrances to
the Hills, only 3,200 feet in elevation, these
are mountains of considerable stature.</p>
<p>The title &ldquo;hills&rdquo; was by no means given the
area by early white settlers. Indeed, if that
majestic domain had not already been named
the Black Hills by the Indians, George Armstrong
Custer, who in 1874 made the first full-scale
exploration of the region, would no doubt
have dignified it with a more appropriate and
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
properly descriptive name&mdash;the Sioux or the
Dakota Mountains, in all probability.</p>
<p>From time beyond remembrance, however,
the region had been known to the Indians as
Paha Sapa, exactly to be translated as &ldquo;Black
Hills,&rdquo; and very properly that name was accepted
by government geographers. The use
of the word &ldquo;black&rdquo; possibly fulfilled several
functions, for not only do these massive peaks
appear decidedly black when seen against the
horizon across distances as great as a hundred
miles, but they were, to the superstitious braves
of the Teton Sioux, the abode of the Thunders
and studiously to be avoided.</p>
<p>This taboo fastness was one of the last regions
in the great American West to be explored
and settled. For one reason, it enjoyed
an isolation from the centers of development
that served to discourage any but the most
hardy of explorers. Lying in the extreme western
end of present-day South Dakota, the
Black Hills were two hundred miles west of
the settlements around Pierre, on the Missouri
River, and two hundred miles north of the
towns along the North Platte, the valley of
the Oregon-California Trail. The most important
reason, though, for its belated opening was
that gold was not discovered in the Black Hills
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
until 1874, and it was the discovery of gold in
various sections which more than any other
single set of circumstances dictated the pattern
of the development of the trans-Mississippi
West.</p>
<p>Even today this fascinating region remains
nearly the most remote of all America&rsquo;s resort
and recreation areas. The Grand Canyon lies
but an hour&rsquo;s drive from a major east-west
transcontinental highway. Estes Park,<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> in the
Rockies, is only seventy miles from the city of
Denver. Glacier Park is easily served by the
Great Northern Railroad on its overland run,
and Yellowstone enjoys direct service by three
railroads. But the Black Hills lie beyond the
privileges of railroad stopovers, and in order to
visit them the tourist has no choice but to plan
a vacation trip for the sake of the Hills themselves
and not as a side venture from any of
the traditional tours of the West. The Hills
are worth the effort.</p>
<p>The Black Hills occupy a rectangular realm
which is roughly one hundred miles long, north
to south, and fifty miles across its east-west
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
axis. The White River Badlands, which are
customarily visited on any Black Hills trip,
form a depression in the high prairies some
forty miles long and fifteen miles across the
widest part. This stark and empty waste is to
be found some seventy-five miles east of the
Black Hills, or, more precisely, east of Rapid
on U.S. Highway 14-16.</p>
<p>There are five major access routes to the
land of Paha Sapa. From the west, which is to
say from Yellowstone Park, five hundred miles
distant, the Hills can be reached by U.S. Highways
14 and 16. These routes come in together
across the high plains of northern Wyoming,
and separate a few hours&rsquo; drive from the South
Dakota border, 14 veering to the north and 16
continuing through the central section of the
Hills.</p>
<p>From the south, U.S. 85 comes up from
Denver, four hundred miles distant, crossing
the Lincoln Highway at Cheyenne, and continuing
along the route of the old Cheyenne-Deadwood
stage.</p>
<p>From Omaha and points in the southeast,
the Hills are best reached over U.S. 20 across
the top side of Nebraska. Although this route
is not a major east-west route for interstate
tourists, it serves a busy agricultural section
and is generally in fine repair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>From the east U.S. 14 and 16, again, bring
the tourist through Pierre, on the Missouri
River, past the Badlands, and into the Hills
through Rapid City. From Minneapolis the
distance is just over six hundred miles, while
from Chicago it is very nearly a thousand.</p>
<p>For those entering the region from the
north, U.S. 12 from Miles City, Montana, is
in all probability the best route.</p>
<p>The gateways to the Black Hills are the
towns of Hot Springs in the south, Rapid City
on the eastern edge, Spearfish or Belle Fourche
at the north, and Custer in the west. All
these towns offer entirely acceptable accommodations
for a touring family; in fact, no one
need drive more than twenty or thirty miles
from any point in the area to find suitable lodgings
at a desired rate.</p>
<p>Hot Springs, on U.S. 18-85A and State 87,
is situated at an altitude of 3,443 feet and has
a population of approximately five thousand.
It is the one sector of the Black Hills that does
not owe its original development to the gold
rush of the seventies, but was sought out from
the earliest days for its natural thermal
springs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>The town is located in a large bowl of the
southern hills known as the Vale of Minnekahta,
from the Sioux name for &ldquo;warm waters.&rdquo;
Situated as it is on the rim of the Hills
region, it was not included in the general taboo
that cloaked the rest of Paha Sapa to the
north; and for nearly a century before its discovery
by the white man in 1875, it was a favored
health resort of the Indians. As a matter
of fact, Battle Mountain, which overlooks the
town, takes its name from a legendary war between
the Sioux and the Cheyenne for the exclusive
privileges of the hot baths.</p>
<p>Not long after the discovery of the springs
a syndicate of investors who had come into the
Hills from Iowa bought the ranch claims that
had been taken out in the Minnekahta Canyon,
and sought to develop the region as a spa. This
was in the late eighties when salubrious waters
were in high fashion as a cure for arthritis and
other joint and muscular disorders of various
degrees of complexity. Colonel Fred T. Evans,
who had made a fortune operating a bull-team
freight line from Fort Pierre to Rapid City,
built an elaborate resort, the Evans Hotel,
which even today is imposing in its last-century
splendor; and with the arrival in 1890 and
1891 of two railroads, the Chicago and Northwestern
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
and the Burlington, wealthy cure-seekers
from all over the United States made
it their habit to spend the summer months in
this pleasant town.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="395" />
<p class="pcap">Highways leading into the Black Hills.</p>
</div>
<p>Healing waters have long since gone out of
vogue as a form of recreation, and although
several clinics still treat a modest number of
visitors for one indisposition or another, the
town of Hot Springs has ceased to be a tourist
center of any consequence. Also, the fact that
the Springs are located a considerable distance
south of U.S. 16, the main east-west route
through the Hills, has contributed to the increasing
isolation which this town enjoys,
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
drowsily seeing to the wants of the occasional
visitor who strays into Paha Sapa from the
south along U.S. 85. But do not mistake it, it
is a pleasant town to stop in, with excellent
motor courts and a good selection of restaurants.</p>
<p>The town of Custer, a scant fifteen miles
from the Wyoming border on U.S. 16, is little
more today than a tourist stopover. It is almost
two thousand feet higher than Hot Springs,
at an altitude of 5,301 feet, and contains, according
to the latest estimates, nearly two
thousand residents.</p>
<p>As the tourist enters the town he will immediately
be amazed by the wide main street; but
if he ponders for a moment the problems of
turning a freight wagon behind sixteen oxen,
the reason will become clear. Custer, the western
gateway to the Hills, was, until the coming
of the railroads, a major way station on the
busy Cheyenne-Deadwood stage and freight
route; and for fifteen years the great bull wagons
teamed into this busy center where, in most
cases, the goods were unloaded and trans-shipped
by lighter wagons into the various
mining centers throughout the northern and
central Hills.</p>
<p>Custer, the oldest of the white man&rsquo;s settlements
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
in Paha Sapa, was founded in 1875 by
gold-seekers who flocked into the territory following
the reports of yellow metal sent back
by George Custer after his exploratory campaign
of 1874. In the first spring and summer
of its existence more than five thousand miners
swarmed into the region to pan gold. This invasion
was a violation of the government&rsquo;s
treaty with the Sioux, and the military forced
the argonauts to leave.</p>
<p>By 1876 the Indian problem had come to a
head with the defeat of General Custer on the
Little Big Horn in eastern Montana; and as
one phase of retaliation the federal government
redrafted the Sioux treaty, allowing
American citizens to enter the Black Hills,
until this time reserved for the Indians. Although
for some time the tribal leaders could
not be persuaded to sign the revised agreement,
the restrictions on settlers were removed, and
back into the Hills rushed the prospectors&mdash;this
time to the new strikes in Deadwood
Gulch, in the north.</p>
<p>By the middle of 1877 Custer, where gold
had originally been found, had a population of
a mere three hundred souls, all of them concerned
primarily with the operation of the
stage stations and hostels. True, a few grizzled
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
placer miners still worked the streams near by,
and do to this day; but hard rock mining in
Deadwood was the new order of affairs.</p>
<p>The visitor to this section of the Hills today
will find it pleasant to stay the night in any
one of a wide choice of tourist courts and other
reasonable billets, and he may see much of historical
interest within a few miles&rsquo; drive of
Custer. A settler&rsquo;s stockade, reconstructed to
the original model of 1874, is a remarkable site
to visit, and the Jewel Cave is best reached
from this point. For sheer color and pageantry
the annual celebration of Gold Discovery
Days, which is held at Custer late in July&mdash;near
the date of the discovery of gold, July 27&mdash;is
an affair not to be missed during a Black
Hills vacation at that time of year.</p>
<p>The town of Spearfish is the point of entrance
to the region on U.S. 14, or, coming in
from the north, on U.S. 85. This tidy metropolis,
called the Queen City of the Black Hills,
never knew the heady history that marked the
early days of Custer, of Deadwood, of Rapid
City, or even of fashionable Hot Springs. Lying
outside the magnificent natural bowl of
mineral deposits, Spearfish was founded and
exists today for the simple purpose of supplying
the inner Hills with food and produce. It
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
has a population of between three and four
thousand people, most of whose energies are
devoted to agriculture and livestock.</p>
<p>Spearfish has, however, carved for itself a
fame and renown even larger, in many quarters,
than that enjoyed by the gold rush towns
of gustier memories. It is the home of the Black
Hills Passion Play.</p>
<p>This beautiful and stirring performance,
which is given in a large amphitheater on Tuesday,
Thursday, and Sunday evenings throughout
the summers, is a resurrection in an
American atmosphere of the centuries-old Passion
of Luenen, in Germany. The man who
plays the Christus, an inherited responsibility
through many generations, is Josef Meier, who
fled from Europe in 1932. For six years, with
a reassembled cast, he toured the United
States, performing a much trimmed-down version
of the historic morality on college campuses,
in civic auditoriums, and at summer
encampments. It was at such a performance
at the Black Hills Teachers College that the
citizens of Spearfish were inspired to offer the
touring company a permanent home. Meier
and his group eagerly accepted the offer, and
the town constructed an outdoor theater seating
eight thousand people. Now, each winter
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
the Passion Play continues its tour of the
United States, but all during July and August
it remains in residence, acting its moving and
majestic pageant to constantly packed houses.</p>
<p>The eastern gateway to the Hills is Rapid
City, a metropolis of thirty thousand people
which lies on the level prairie just to the east
of the final ring of foothills. Founded, like
Spearfish, not as a mining center but to serve
the near-by gold regions, Rapid City has developed
a maze of industrial and commercial
enterprises. Shipping, of course, has been a
basic form of commerce from the earliest days,
with the two most heavily traveled trails into
the Black Hills, that from Fort Pierre and
that from Sidney, Nebraska, on the Union
Pacific, entering the gold area at Rapid City.
Lumbering, manufacture, banking, and livestock
quickly became prominent as the gold
fever subsided and the more permanent settlers
began coming into the region to take up the
rich cattle and farming lands in western South
Dakota. A final guarantee that Rapid City
will continue to flourish may be seen in the selection
by the Air Force of the high, level
prairie land just ten miles to the east of the
city as the nation&rsquo;s major mid-continent
bomber base.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Rapid City is served by U.S. Highway 14-16,
and South Dakota state highways 40
and 79. Two railroads and a major airline assist
in handling the heavy summer tourist
travel, and from Rapid City practically every
point of interest in the Black Hills can be
reached by car within three hours.</p>

<br />The Formation of the Black Hills</h2>
<p>One of the most rewarding features of a
visit to the Black Hills is the opportunity
for the average individual, who has no
technical training, to see with his own eyes a
museum of the earth&rsquo;s ages and a living sample
of practically every one of the many aeons of
the planet&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>The Hills, which is to say the rock substances
of the region, are older by hundreds of millions
of years than the stone out-juttings of the
Rocky Mountains. Layer after layer of slates
and schists from the very foundations of this
globe lie visibly exposed as the end result of
a doming of the region, a vast blistering, as it
were, which raised the entire structure, layer
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
upon layer, several thousand feet in the air.
Following this doming process, a vigorous program
of erosion commenced. Stratum by stratum
the winds and rains cut across this huge
blister in a horizontal plane, eventually laying
the core open at the height above sea level at
which we find the Black Hills today. From
that core, extending in every direction in the
general form of a circle, the various strata
which once lay so smoothly one upon another
have been laid open as one might slice off the
top of an orange.</p>

<p class="pcapc"><span class="ss">The forces of erosion&mdash;wind
and water&mdash;have
levelled the dome and
opened the seams to
view.</span></p>
</div>
<p>In order to get an even clearer picture of
how this amazing phenomenon came about
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
through the aeons, let us fold back the ages to
the very birth of this planet.</p>
<p>For centuries men have attempted to determine
the earth&rsquo;s exact age, but except for the
famed Archbishop James Ussher of Ireland,
who gravely calculated that the earth was
formed at precisely nine o&rsquo;clock on the morning
of the twelfth of October in the year 4004
B.C., no scientist has been able to come closer
than a few million years in the figures.
Through a number of trustworthy measurements,
however&mdash;including, in recent years, the
examination of the deterioration of radioactive
elements in rocks&mdash;geologists have agreed that
the oldest known ingredients of the earth&rsquo;s
crust have been in existence at least two billion
years, and, according to some very recent calculations,
possibly as long as three and a half
billion.</p>
<p>In what is known as the Archean period,
the most ancient of which we have any geological
knowledge, a vast sea covered much of
North America, bounded by certain masses of
land, the extent of which has never been discovered.
From this land mass remnants of
mud and sand were broken away by waves and
deposited on the floor of the sea. Eventually,
under the pressure of its own weight, this material
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
formed shales and sandstones to an undetermined
depth&mdash;many thousands of feet.
Those particular sandstones and shales underlie
the entire Black Hills area and extend in
nearly every direction for a considerable distance,
suggesting perhaps that the area of the
Hills was at one time the bottom of this watery
bowl.</p>
<p>The Archean period came to an end some
five hundred million years ago. By then the
seas had withdrawn, and the new land formations
which had lain under the early ocean
merged with the vestiges of the first land mass.
But this metamorphosis, which can be described
in such calm fashion, was by no means
a gentle affair. It took place largely as the result
of a shifting and rising of certain ocean
bottom areas, among which was the region
where we now find the Black Hills.</p>
<p>At the time of this uplift, and possibly contributing
to it, there was a tremendous disturbance
in the lower regions of the earth
which sent great streams of molten matter up
into the several-mile-thick layer of shale,
through which it poured toward the surface,
breaking through in monolithic forms and
hardening into granite. The New Mexico
writer, Eugene Manlove Rhodes, describing
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
a similar geologic phenomenon in the valley of
the Rio Grande, has called it &ldquo;like sticking a
knife through a tambourine,&rdquo; and indeed it
was. Harney Peak, in Custer State Park, is
just such a granite finger pointing up through
the original shales toward the sky.</p>
<p>When this disturbance took place the granite
juttings did not rise above the surrounding
landscape as they now do. In many cases they
did not even reach the surface of the shale beds,
but ceased their flow and hardened short of
the crust of the earth, as it was then to be
found. When, however, the region was domed,
many millions of years later, the subsequent
weathering of the huge blister did not attack
these granite formations with anywhere near
the vigor with which the softer sandstones and
limestones were eroded. What actually occurred,
then, was a peeling away of the softer
rocks, leaving the granite formations near their
original sizes, but at last above the ground level
in the form of peaks, needles, and spires.</p>
<p>But we have gotten ahead of our story. Following
the Algonkian period, when the molten
matter was injected into the layers of shale,
there came what is known as the Cambrian
period. The Cambrian occupied the first 80,000,000
years of the Paleozoic era, which in
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
itself covered the entire period from 510,000,000
to 180,000,000 years ago.</p>
<p>During the Cambrian period the land subsided
again, perhaps because of the weight of
the uplifted sedimentary formations. During
this subsidence the waters once again covered
vast portions of North America, and additional
muds and slimes were deposited on the bottom.
It was at this period that life first appeared
on the earth, in the form of simple marine organisms
which have left fossil remains. These
deposits made in the Cambrian period can be
seen in outcroppings all through the region,
although they are most notably found in the
area about Deadwood. Because of their structure
they indicate to the geologist that the
shoreline of the ancient Cambrian sea was near
at hand, and also that this covering of water
was by no means as extensive or as deep as the
earlier Archean sea.</p>
<p>The deposits of sand and mud, which were
eventually pressed into stone, occasionally
reach a depth of as much as five hundred feet,
although they were laid down extremely
slowly, as eddying mud is laid at the bottom
of a pond. In the locality of Deadwood they
contained a rich infiltration of gold, and the
entire conglomeration was thoroughly intermixed
with a vast outcropping of much older
rock&mdash;this effect undoubtedly having taken
place later, during the great continental uplift,
when the final doming occurred.</p>

<p>The next period of the earth&rsquo;s age&mdash;the
Ordovician period, which extended from 430,000,000
to 350,000,000 years ago&mdash;has left its
mark just as visibly upon the Black Hills. It
was during this period that the many species of
invertebrate marine life reached a zenith of
development, and that a bed of sediment was
laid down and later compressed to a pinkish
limestone. The fact that this Ordovician bed
is less than forty feet thick indicates that the
land mass from which the muds and sands were
drawn was very low, and that the Cambrian
sea was relatively shallow, entertaining only
minor erosive currents along its shores.</p>
<p>The next two ages, the Silurian and the
Devonian, which brought our earth down to a
scant 250,000,000 years ago, did not see the
deposit of any silting in the Black Hills region.
No doubt the waters which covered the locality
dried up gradually. The Mississippian period,
however, was a time of great depositional activity.
A layer of limestone between five and
six hundred feet thick was set down over the
entire section. In later periods this limestone
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
underwent much decay and water erosion,
which formed the amazing caverns for which
the Black Hills are known. Wind Cave, now
the site of a National Park, Crystal Cave, and
Jewel Cave are the best-known tourist attractions
among the many, although there are a
number of lesser ones, some even today only
partially explored.</p>
<p>The chemical activity which accomplished
this erosion was caused by the seeping of rain
water down through later accumulations of
sediment on top of the layer of limestone. As
it seeped through rotting vegetation and timber
the water collected carbonic acid gases
which, when it reached the level of the Mississippian
limestone, eroded the structure and
ate out huge hollows in it.</p>
<p>The thickness of the Mississippian deposit
indicated that at this time the earth had again
sunk beneath the waters to a considerable
depth. The shallow sea which had not offered
sediment to a greater depth than a few feet
was replaced by active currents which carried
heavier sedimentary materials from great distances,
laying them down on the floor of the
sea in various strata to a depth of several hundred
feet. Finally, after an unknown number
of millions of years, but perhaps during the
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
Triassic period, the land again rose above the
level of the waters. A red shale suggests a time
of great aridity when the region must have
been a near desert, and certain discernible patterns
in the shales suggest periods of rapid
evaporation and a consequent change in chemical
activity.</p>
<p>Finally the land subsided again, for the last
time to date. At times salt water covered the
region, and at other times fresh water left its
chemical mark. At some levels in this last
layer of sedimentary rocks an abundance of
fossils can be found, indicating deep water, and
at others ripple-marked rock indicates very
shallow water. It remains a period of great
mystery. How long this final submersion continued
we do not know; but in all probability
it lasted nearly a hundred million years, and
then was terminated by the vast upending of
North America which created the Rocky
Mountains. This upheaval did not take place
suddenly, as a volcanic eruption or a series of
earthquakes, but apparently commenced about
sixty million years ago and lasted, as a continuous
series of shiftings and slow upheavals,
for about twenty million years.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this mighty uplifting
the region of the Black Hills was covered by
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
the various layers of sedimentary deposits to
a depth of nearly two miles. Slowly this rectangular
area was lifted as a dome over the
surrounding prairies. We do not know how
high above the level lands this dome reached,
but we do know that several thousand feet of
later deposits overcapped the granite upthrusts
which were planted in the fundamental shales.
Those granite fingers, which have now been
exposed to view, stand from five hundred to
four thousand feet above the plains, and thus
the original dome may be assumed to have extended
from eight to ten thousand feet above
our present-day sea level.</p>
<p>Almost as soon as this era of upheaval first
started, as soon as the first land of the Black
Hills was elevated above the great sea, the
forces of erosion set to work. Wind and rain
worked their terrifying magic on the slowly
rising terrain, carving away the softer rocks
and the loose dirt and leaving only the granite
outcroppings. Down from the sides of the
great dome poured the waters of melting
snows, gushing springs, and torrential rainfalls,
digging out rivers, canyons, and the
deep and narrow cuts which characterize this
beautiful region. Slowly the land continued to
rise and the oceans to fall until at last an equilibrium
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
was reached, a static state of affairs
which remained much the same until our own
period, when the base of the dome was at last
revealed, with the surrounding lands drifting
away in every direction on a gentle incline.</p>
<p>From that day the structure of the Black
Hills has changed but little. The high winds
off the Dakota plains and the annual spring
run-off and seasonal rains cut their minute
etchings in the landscape; but Nature&rsquo;s greatest
effort in the Black Hills part of the world
has, it seems, been made. It must be remembered,
though, that Nature has had other responsibilities.
At the time of the doming of
the Black Hills the Alps had not yet been
formed, nor the Pyrenees, nor the Caucasus.
And on the site of the mountains we know
today as the sky-piercing Himalayas, the
swampy waters still moldered.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><span class="smaller">CHAPTER THREE</span></span>
<br />The Hills Today</h2>
<p>It is this writer&rsquo;s personal opinion that no
other resort area in the United States possesses
such a wealth of tourist attractions as
the Black Hills. This profusion of happy endowments
can be separated into three categories,
each of which deserves individual study
and enjoyment. Two of these, the region&rsquo;s
folklore and its memories of the gold rush, belong
to the amazing history of the Hills. But
of course the visible landscape and the natural
wonders of the area are the primary objects of
the tourist&rsquo;s visits, and it is proper that they
be considered immediately and in detail.</p>
<h3><i>Wind Cave</i></h3>
<p>The Wind Cave lies ten miles north of Hot
Springs on U.S. 85A. The cavern is the focal
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
point of interest in its own National Park,
which takes in forty square miles. Nearly half
of this park is enclosed with a high fence, behind
which one of the last great bison herds
roams contentedly. Protected antelope, elk,
and deer also enjoy this game preserve.</p>
<p>The cavern was discovered, according to
legend, by a cowboy who heard a continued low
whistling noise in the weeds and, investigating,
found air rushing from a ten-inch hole near the
present entrance to the cave. And indeed it
is this very phenomenon that makes Wind
Cave different from other notable caverns, such
as the one at Carlsbad. Even on the stillest of
days a steady current of air can be felt rushing
in or out of the cave&rsquo;s opening&mdash;into the earth
if the barometer is rising, and out of the
ground if the pressure is falling.</p>
<p>The National Park Service conducts tours
of the cave, the complete excursion lasting
some two hours. Fortunately, although the
visitor descends to a great depth as he searches
out the various chambers on the route, the tour
ends at an elevator which whisks him swiftly
to the surface near the starting point.</p>
<p>The entire cavern is a little more than ten
miles long, although there are portions of it
which have not even yet been explored so that
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
their size may be known with accuracy. It is
not graced with the growths of stalactites and
stalagmites normally to be found in limestone
formations, but nature has compensated for
that lack by fashioning a peculiar box-work
which looks for all the world as if the cavern
had been subjected to an interminable frosting
process. These beautiful fretwork deposits,
which are not to be found in any other cave, are
the result of a strange chemical process that
took place in the limestone stratum where
Wind Cave is located. Surface water seeping
into the stone became charged with carbon dioxide
gas from the decaying organic matter
through which it passed. This gentle acid then
dissolved the limestone only to redeposit it in
cracks and crevices around other limestone
fragments. The precipitated limestone was of
a different chemical composition and resisted
later onslaughts by the eroding acids&mdash;which,
however, did eat away the fragments around
which the precipitate had formed, leaving the
maze of hollow crystalline formations that can
be seen in the various chambers of the cavern.</p>
<p>The National Park, being relatively small,
is not equipped with overnight facilities; but
this does not matter, for the town of Hot
Springs is but twenty minutes&rsquo; drive from the
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
park, and the town of Custer is only twenty
miles away. There are, however, camping
grounds in the park, and the Park Service operates
a lunchroom at the entrance to the cave.</p>
<h3><i>Custer State Park</i></h3>
<p>Custer State Park is located almost in the center
of the Black Hills. Containing nearly one
hundred and fifty thousand acres, it is one of
the largest state parks in America. It was
originally set aside as a state game refuge, and
it was not until the advent of summer touring
as a national pastime that the state of South
Dakota purchased additional private lands
which contained scenic wonders, incorporating
all of them into the one large area.</p>
<p>Today the park is the center of all tourist
activity in the region. A number of excellent
lodges, camp grounds, and tourist courts along
every road make it particularly easy for the
tourist to stop at will for a day or more to enjoy
the various recreational facilities as his
fancy dictates. In every respect the park is
effectively administered: food and lodging
prices are held to a reasonable figure, the cleanliness
of the buildings and grounds is regularly
inspected, and the landscape is protected from
commercial exploitation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>The center of the park&rsquo;s activities is the
Game Lodge, a monstrous Victorian hotel
built in 1919 and operated under a private
lease. Close by the Game Lodge are cabins,
stores, eating establishments, the park zoo, a
museum, and the offices of the state park officials.
The Lodge, those with a flair for nostalgia
will recall, achieved international renown
in 1927 when President Coolidge made it the
summer White House. It lies on US. 16,
thirty-two miles from Rapid City and seventeen
miles from the town of Custer.</p>
<p>It behooves the writer to mention at this
point that the museum connected with the
Game Lodge is by no means the drab and
dusty sort of collection of impedimenta associated
with the vicinity that is so often found in
museums at scenic sites. Indeed, this fine attraction
is an assemblage of geological, paleontological,
and historical items which trace with
rare discernment the whole history of the Hills
through the ages, and up to our own day. The
visitor who fails to pass an hour in this exciting
spot will have missed the heart of the Hills
entirely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<h3><i>Harney Peak</i></h3>
<p>Harney Peak stands like a sentinel in Custer
Park. The highest point in the Black Hills,
it rises to an altitude of 7,242 feet, 4,000 feet
above the prairie floor outside the Hills.
Higher by 900 feet than Mount Washington
in New Hampshire, it is the highest mountain
east of the Rockies.</p>
<p>High as it is, Harney Peak is by no means
the typical mountain which tourists come to
expect after a trip through Colorado, for example,
or western Wyoming. It is older by
ages than the precipitous and craggy Rockies,
and the winds and waters have worked their
slow erosion on it, cutting away what high
shelves and escarpments might originally have
existed and leaving it, except at the top, a gentle
and easy mountain that may be climbed
over a trail which will scarcely tax the laziest
tourist.</p>
<p>On the top of the peak will be found the core
of granite that originally broke through the
Archean shales. This granite, subject to the
mechanical ravages of wind, rain, and frost,
is rugged and coarse, a steep dome covered
with a thick lichen. From this eminence the entire
Black Hills area can be seen, rolling away
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
in every direction&mdash;great waves of pinnacle
and mountain, gradually subsiding and disappearing
in the haze of distance which covers
the prairies. Especially striking from this spot
is the view of Cathedral Park, with its hundreds
of needle-like spires and organ pipes,
and, sheltered in a quiet recess, that amazing
phenomenon, Sylvan Lake.</p>
<h3><i>The Needles</i></h3>
<p>The Needles Highway, a fourteen-mile stretch
of road, branches off U.S. 16 about five miles
west of the Game Lodge. At the time of its
construction in 1920-21 it was regarded as an
engineering marvel, although later exploits of
American highway builders, such as the road
to the top of fourteen-thousand-foot Mount
Evans in Colorado, have since far overshadowed
this accomplishment.</p>
<p>The road winds and curves in an interminable
pattern, finding its way, by trial and error
it seems, among the great granite spires
that give the region its name. These &ldquo;needles,&rdquo;
through the last of which the highway actually
plunges in a tunnel, are the remains of a great
granite plateau which once covered that entire
portion of the Black Hills. Contrary to popular
opinion, the rocks are not outthrusts, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
result of some ancient upheaval, but the last
thin vestiges of this once-solid plateau. The
age-old process of erosion has carved them into
the shapes they now have; and the inquiring
visitor can see the process still at work, for
upon close inspection this granite is found to
be not the impregnable stone it appears, but
rock in a late stage of disintegration. Rot is
the word which actually describes this formation,
and in many spots whole chunks can be
picked from the side of a spire by hand. It was,
as a matter of fact, this situation which made
the construction of the Needles Highway possible.
Had the granite been solid, the task of
cutting the Needles and Iron Creek tunnels
would have been so expensive as to prohibit the
entire undertaking.</p>
<h3><i>Sylvan Lake</i></h3>
<p>Not all of the scenery in the Black Hills was
created by Nature. Sylvan Lake, in many respects
the most beautiful corner of the region,
was made entirely by hand.</p>
<p>It was near the turn of the century when
two hunters, Dr. Jennings of Hot Springs
and Joseph Spencer of Chicago, got the intriguing
idea of having an additional tourist
attraction in the vicinity of Harney Peak&mdash;a
lake.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig1">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="801" />
<p class="pcap">Along the Needles Highway</p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="fig2">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="" width="896" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Harney Peak older by ages than the Rockies</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Some lakes are difficult to construct, while
some are relatively easy. Sylvan belongs in the
latter category. The two imaginative gentlemen
merely bought a small tract of land between
two great granite shields and built a
dam seventy-five feet high between the boulders.
The waters of Sunday Creek, which
flowed to their dam, together with local
springs, at last contrived to fill the area back
of the dam. Today this loveliest of lakes basks
peacefully high above the world at an elevation
of 6,250 feet, actually on top of a ridge, at the
north terminal of the Needles Highway.</p>
<p>It is easy for any lover of water scenes to
become enthusiastic as he describes the colorations
of his favorite lake, so I shall merely state
that Sylvan never looks the same in two consecutive
moments. Not having the symmetry
of natural lakes or the tremendous depths of
glacial pools, this body of water plays the role
of mirror to the fabulous rock shapes which
surround it; and indeed it is a source of never-ending
delight to watch the cloud and sun patterns
as they wrestle with the shadows of the
rocks on its surface.</p>
<p>For many years Sylvan Lake and its environs
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
were operated privately. A hotel catered
to the tourists who bounced over the privately
built road in buggies and horse-drawn busses.
In 1919 the property was purchased by the
state of South Dakota, and since that time it
has been operated as a public facility. When
the original hotel burned, in the thirties, the
state built with funds procured from the federal
government a comfortable and modern
hostelry, the most amazing feature of which
is the expansive dining room with picture windows
looking out over the lake to Harney
Peak.</p>
<p>The hotel is small, as resort hotels go, containing
only fifty rooms, and the tourist would
do well to arrange for accommodations in advance
of his visit. There are, however, a number
of cabins operated in conjunction with the
main building, and except at the height of the
season rooms can probably be found in the annexes.
Along the lake shore an excellent restaurant,
independent of the hotel, serves the
needs of the traveler who has only a few hours
to spend at this stop.</p>
<h3><i>Mount Rushmore</i></h3>
<p>From Sylvan Lake around back of the north
side of Harney Peak it is a drive of but a few
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
miles to the second man-made wonder of the
Hills&mdash;the Mount Rushmore Memorial.</p>
<p>Perhaps no one thing has done so much to
make the Black Hills known throughout the
world as this incredible undertaking&mdash;the carving
in the natural granite face of a mountain
of the faces of our four most revered presidents:
Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and
Theodore Roosevelt. &ldquo;Teddy&rdquo; is included for
his lasting service to the people of the United
States as the president who saw the Panama
Canal project through Congress and into being.
The military and economic values of that
enterprise so deeply impressed the sculptor of
this mammoth frieze that he insisted upon elevating
TR into the august company of the
other three great statesmen.</p>
<p>The whole story of the memorial would fill
several volumes, and indeed has already done
so. Briefly, the sculptor, Gutzon Borglum,
wished to perpetuate a patriotic motif in stone
figures so large that they would attract visitors
from every corner of the country and impress
upon them the glories of the democracy which
the four presidents had done so much to build
and sustain. The sculptor&rsquo;s own words were:
&ldquo;I want, somewhere in America, on or near
the Rockies, the backbone of the continent, a
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
few feet of stone that carries the likenesses,
the dates, and a word or two of the great things
we accomplished as a Nation, placed so high
that it won&rsquo;t pay to pull it down for lesser
purposes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The actual construction work started in
1926, and the formal dedication was made by
President Coolidge in the summer of 1927.
Between nine hundred thousand and a million
dollars went into the gigantic task, including
money for supplies, wages, and the sculptor&rsquo;s
own personal needs during the fifteen years he
spent on the project. He died in 1941, and the
work was completed a few months later by his
son.</p>
<p>The immensity of the undertaking can be
grasped when the dimensions are noted. The
face of each of the figures, for example, measures
sixty feet from chin to forehead.</p>
<p>The rough carving was done by dynamite.
Borglum, working from a carefully constructed
model, would mark on the sheer sides
of the great mountain the lines where he
wanted the stone peeled away. Then a blast
would be set off in the hope that the rock
displacement would approximate the lines
marked out, and from that point the work had
to be done by hand. At first, taking lessons
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
from the miners working for him who had
many years of experience in blasting the hard
granites of the region, Borglum was able to
reach only within a foot of the final figure by
dynamiting. As he became more proficient in
the use of the explosives he got to the point
where his original blasts would shed the stone
to a matter of an inch or less from the final cut
surface. The head of Washington was finished
in 1930, that of Jefferson in 1936, that of Lincoln
a year later, and that of Theodore Roosevelt,
the final figure, in 1941.</p>
<p>There are no tourist facilities at the site of
the Memorial. Like every other place in the
Black Hills, however, Rushmore can be
reached in a few minutes&rsquo; drive from any one
of a number of near-by points where a tourist
might be stopping. Borglum&rsquo;s studio, situated
on a prominence a few hundred yards from the
carvings, gives the best view of the scene and
is open to the public.</p>
<h3><i>Crazy Horse</i></h3>
<p>It is not entirely accurate to refer to the Mount
Rushmore Memorial as <i>the</i> other man-made
wonder in the Hills. At the moment it is the
only such marvel outside of Sylvan Lake; but
in twenty-five or thirty years it will have to
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
share that honor with the Crazy Horse Memorial,
a statue carved on top of Thunderhead
Mountain, between Harney Peak and the town
of Custer. This gigantic carving, which will
be an entire figure and not a mere bas-relief,
will be an equestrian statue of the great Sioux
chief, Crazy Horse, who led his nation during
the desperate years between 1866 and 1877.
The chief will be mounted on a prancing steed,
his hair blowing, as if in the wind, behind him.</p>
<p>The Indians themselves can take the credit
for this fabulous idea. Chief Henry Standing
Bear, a resident of the Pine Ridge reservation,
is said to have had his inspiration after a visit
to Mount Rushmore. Why not, he wondered,
erect some monument to an outstanding red
man, so that when the last of his people have
been assimilated into the white man&rsquo;s society,
visitors to what was once the heart of the Indian
country can reflect for a moment upon
the greatness of that lost race?</p>
<p>Standing Bear wrote his idea to Korczak
Ziolkowski, an energetic and imaginative
sculptor, and suggested that Chief Crazy
Horse would make a fitting symbol of the Indians&rsquo;
struggle for existence. This was in 1940.</p>
<p>The sculptor took to the idea, but because
of the events of World War II he was unable
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
to commence work on the project until 1947.
Since then he has been setting off two blasts
of dynamite a day, carving away the rock at
the top of Thunderhead. But even yet the first
faint outlines of the eventual statue are only
barely discernible. Ziolkowski estimates that
the entire task will consume a quarter of a century,
if not more, and will cost not less than
five million dollars. If this figure sounds high
compared with the less than a million spent on
Rushmore, perhaps the measurements will provide
an explanation: the horse upon which the
chief will be seated will be four hundred feet
from nose to tail, and the entire work, from
pedestal to top, will be more than five hundred
feet in height.</p>
<h3><i>Mount Coolidge</i></h3>
<p>In this same general region lies another prominent
Black Hills landmark which every tourist
should take time to visit&mdash;Mount Coolidge.
With a height of 6,400 feet, this peak is by no
means an outstanding mountain, being ranked
by a good half dozen higher within the Hills.
But from its summit, which can be reached by
an auto road leading off U.S. 85A a few miles
to the north of Wind Cave Park, an amazing
vista can be seen. To the east, on a clear day,
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
the White River Badlands loom as a great valley
sixty miles away. To the south one can see
across the high rolling hills all the way into
Nebraska, and to the west landmarks in Wyoming
are clearly visible. On the summit a
stone lookout tower has been built for the convenience
of visitors.</p>
<h3><i>Jewel Cave and Ice Cave</i></h3>
<p>Since the Black Hills are underbedded so
widely by limestone, it is not surprising to find
in them not one but several memorable caverns.
There are, as a matter of fact, a dozen or
more well-known large caves; but outside of
Wind Cave, only Jewel Cave has been opened
and fully prepared for public visit. The expense
of exploring, lighting, and carving trails
in the others has kept them off the market, so
to speak, for in a region so packed with scenic
delights two great caverns are about as much
as the traffic will bear.</p>
<p>Jewel Cave lies some fourteen miles west of
Custer on U.S. 16, almost at the Wyoming-South
Dakota border. It is a small cave, with
only two tours marked out in it, one a mile
long and the other two miles. It is noted for
its wealth of colorful crystalline deposits, totally
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
unlike the delicate filigree work to be
found in Wind Cave.</p>
<p>The cave was discovered by two prospectors,
who proceeded to develop their property for
commercial gain. In 1934 they sold the cave
and such of its environs as they owned to the
Newcastle, Wyoming, Lions Club and the
Custer Chamber of Commerce. These two organizations
sought to popularize it further as
a lure to tourists who would have to travel
through their towns to reach the scene. In
1938 the federal government took it over and
made a national monument of it.</p>
<p>Not far from Jewel Cave is the famous Ice
Cave. This cavern gets its name from the current
of cold air which blows from its mouth,
cold and clammy on even the hottest of summer
days. The Ice Cave is not officially open
to the public, and has not even been totally explored.
Forest rangers and Park Service employees
have charted some of it and have
searched out certain channels in the strange
formation, and from their meager reports it
would seem that if Ice Cave is ever fully
opened it will vie with New Mexico&rsquo;s Carlsbad
in beauty and grandeur.</p>
<p>For the curious tourist the only possibility
at the moment is to take the lovely off-route
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
trip to the cave&rsquo;s entrance, a natural arch
twenty feet high and seventy-five feet wide.</p>
<p>In addition to Wind Cave, Jewel Cave, and
Ice Cave, there are a number of other caverns
of varying interest and underground beauty
which have been opened and exploited by private
individuals. In many cases these are but
indifferently arranged for public inspection,
but can be tracked down by the visitor by
means of the garish signs which too often
manage to clutter the otherwise unblemished
scenery.</p>
<h3><i>Just Scenery</i></h3>
<p>The foregoing are only a very few of the
scenic wonders of the Black Hills. Detailed information
on the various other scenic features
is easily to be had at any of the hotels and
tourist courts in the Hills, and brochures covering
practically every landmark are available
gratis, thanks to the enthusiasm of the local
chambers of commerce, the Black Hills and
Badlands Association, and the state of South
Dakota. The area is crisscrossed with good
roads, and no matter which route one takes to
his eventual destination, every mile will be
marked by breath-taking views and natural
wonders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>The region, except at the summits of the
peaks, lies at an average altitude of some five
thousand feet. Cool nights are thus guaranteed,
regardless of the temperatures by day.
The highest mean temperature ranges, during
the six months between April and November,
from 60 to 85 degrees. Light outing clothes are
suggested for day wear, and light wraps are
always in order after dark.</p>
<p>The rainfall during this same six-month
period, averaged over fifty years, amounts to
three inches per month; what small showers
do occur take place most usually in an hour or
so of the early afternoon, and refresh rather
than hinder the tourist.</p>
<p>The hillsides are covered with a mass of
shrub and tree growth, and an earnest searcher
can find specimens of no less than fifty-two
varieties. Yellow pine, spruce, cedar, ash,
aspen, alder, dogwood, and cottonwood are
most in evidence.</p>
<p>The bird lover will find the Black Hills nothing
less than a vast aviary, more than two
hundred species having been seen in the region.
Animal life is almost as widely represented,
although the casual visitor is not likely to come
upon a native mountain lion or gray wolf. The
assistance of forest rangers and Park Service
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
employees is available in locating the habitats
of some of the rarer varieties of wildlife.</p>
<p>As might be expected, the fisherman will
find plenty of opportunity to ply his pole in
this region. There are nearly 150 miles of
stream and lake frontage in the Black Hills,
and the waters are liberally stocked by the
state hatcheries. In addition to trout, the angler
will encounter pike, pickerel, bluegills,
black bass, and perch.</p>
<p>Finally, there are the annual celebrations
and fairs, which are always of interest to the
outsider, for they help dramatize the particular
region where they are held and its historical
background. July and August are the months
for these celebrations, and notices of coming
events will be found posted prominently&rsquo; along
the tourist routes. Four such outstanding occasions
are Black Hills Range Days at Rapid
City, Gold Discovery Days at Custer, the
Belle Fourche Round-Up, and the Days of
&rsquo;76 at Deadwood. The Deadwood celebration,
it might be added, celebrates not the Revolutionary
War, but the discovery of gold in
Deadwood Gulch in 1876.</p>

<br />History I: Indians and Gold</h2>
<p>Gold, they say, is where you find it.
In California in 1848&mdash;in Montana in
1852&mdash;in Colorado in 1858&mdash;in Arizona, in
Nevada: when they finally found it in the
Black Hills in 1874, the Gold Rush West had
nearly all been settled and the bonanza days
were forever gone, for all the likely places had
been searched.</p>
<p>The question posed is an obvious one. With
sourdoughs plowing and digging up the bed
of every stream and rivulet in the West from
1849 on, how did it come about that the Black
Hills, lying a considerable distance closer to
home than California and the other gold rush
regions, had kept their glittering secret until
so late?</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that the mysterious
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
and brooding dark mountain-land was a
good place to hide secrets. Gold had been discovered
there, as a matter of fact, as early as
1834, which was just seven years after the
country&rsquo;s first gold strike&mdash;the 1827 Georgia
rush. But unfortunately those first lucky gold-seekers&mdash;there
were six of them&mdash;did not live
to enjoy their taste of the Black Hills&rsquo; incredible
wealth. Fifty-three years later, not far
from the town of Spearfish, one Louis Thoen
found a piece of limestone upon which was
crudely but legibly engraved this melancholy
message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>came to these hills in 1833, seven of us DeLacompt Ezra
Kind G. W. Wood T Brown R Kent WM King Indian
Crow All ded but me Ezra Kind Killed by Indians beyond
the high hill got our gold june 1834</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the back of this somber relic were the
blunt words: &ldquo;Got all gold we could carry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, there was gold in plenty, but Paha
Sapa of the Hills was a jealous spirit who
guarded the forbidden portals with a great
vengeance. It is interesting, though, to speculate
upon how the course of western history
might have veered had Ezra Kind made his
way out of the bleak region to report his discovery.
Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and most of
the Missouri Valley would have been skipped
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
over in a rush to the prairie West, left to be
filled in and settled later. The upriver ports of
the Missouri, rather than St. Louis, Kansas
City, St. Joseph, and Omaha, would have been
the outposts, and there would have been no
Santa Fe Trail, no Platte River&mdash;Oregon
Trail, but rather a heavily traveled National
Road winding out from St. Paul and from
Chicago. Rapid City would have been a metropolis
the size of Denver, and when eventually
the Union Pacific was built it would
have been three hundred miles north of its present
route. And the Indians? There would have
been a far different story in that regard, perhaps
a much bloodier and more tragic tale.</p>
<p>But Ezra Kind was killed and his secret
slept, and thus we are as we are today. Actually
it was the Indians who kept the Hills so
long forbidden&mdash;Indians of the Teton Sioux,
the same tribe who put Ezra&rsquo;s party to the
tomahawk.</p>
<p>Before the California gold rush life on the
Great Plains had proceeded pretty much on
an even keel. The mighty Teton Sioux, all
seven tribes of them&mdash;the Oglalas, the Unkpapas,
the San Arcs, the Brules, the Minniconjous,
the Blackfeet, and the Two Kettle&mdash;roamed
the prairies at will, from the Missouri
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
Valley to the Rocky Mountains. Of course
they had their misadventures with the fur companies,
but just as often their dealings with
the Mountain Men were profitable, for the
Indians, when in the mood, scouted, trapped,
and hunted, all for the white man&rsquo;s pay.</p>
<p>With the great exodus to California, though,
the situation took on a different hue. Immigrants
by the hundreds and the thousands
poured up the rolling valley of the Platte, and
it was not many months before the haphazard
Indian attacks took on a new strength and design.
Long burned the council fires in the dark
nights, and all up and down the great plains
the war raged. To protect the wagon trains
the government sent its shrewdest and most
experienced Indian agent, Thomas Fitzpatrick,
a veteran fur trader since 1823, the famed
&ldquo;Broken Hand&rdquo; of western legend. Summoning
the tribes to Fort Laramie in 1851, Fitzpatrick
managed to subdue them, but only by
promising that he would confine the settlers
to specific ranges and would keep them steadfastly
out of the Dakotas and the Black Hills.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the eastern tribes, the Santee
Sioux, were beginning to feel the pressure
of settlement in the rich Minnesota valleys. In
1862 they revolted, and the terrible battle of
Wood Lake was fought, with the score of massacred
settlers reaching into the high hundreds.
The leaders of this outrage were, of course,
apprehended and punished, but whole tribes
fled into the western plains, into the land
of the Black Hills, where they eventually
joined forces with their Teton cousins.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>By 1865 matters had come to a head again,
because although the great Sioux, numbering
between thirty and forty thousand, had kept
to themselves, the white man had broken his
side of the bargain and was cutting a new route
into the forbidden country. This passage was
the famed Bozeman Trail, which drove north
from Fort Laramie, on the Oregon Trail, directly
through the Sioux country to serve the
new gold fields of Montana.</p>
<p>To protect the wagon trains on the Bozeman
the army called upon General Grenville
Dodge, who was later to build the Union Pacific.
Dodge, Commandant of the Department
of the Missouri, was an old hand at Indian
warfare. He rushed into Wyoming a full force,
four columns of men, who swiftly brought the
angered tribes to heel.</p>
<p>The immediate result of this engagement
was the signing of a halfhearted and inconclusive
treaty at Fort Sully, near Pierre, in October
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
of 1865. The treaty attempted to settle
some old differences of a fundamental nature,
but inasmuch as neither the Oglala nor the
Brule were represented it failed of its mission.</p>
<p>A year later a further powwow was staged
at Fort Laramie to pursue the matter of keeping
the Bozeman Trail open through the forbidden
Sioux country. Perhaps matters might
have proceeded equably had not General Carrington
arrived in the midst of the delicate negotiations
to announce that he had enough
soldiers to protect the trail, treaty or no treaty.</p>
<p>Carrington&rsquo;s blustery announcement, backed
up by a show of seven hundred courageous but
misguided cavalrymen, brought the talks to an
abrupt end and sent the two most important
Sioux Chieftains, Red Cloud and Crazy Horse,
scurrying for the council fire and the war
paths. In all the great plains there were not to
be found braver or more single-minded Indian
strategists than these two. For the better part
of two years roving bands of tribesmen under
Red Cloud and his stalwart colleague amply
proved that Carrington could not have kept
the trail safely open if he had had seventy times
his seven hundred men. It was, as a matter of
fact, the only time in our long history that
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
Uncle Sam&rsquo;s troops ever took a downright
beating.</p>
<p>At last even Red Cloud could see that the
white man, for all his braggadocio and poor
planning, would eventually win the turn; and
although his savage troops had tasted victory
in almost every engagement, he consented in
1868 to negotiate once more. Presumably both
sides were wiser by then, for a pact, sometimes
called the Harney-Sanborne Treaty, was dutifully
signed and accepted in April of that year.
The United States agreed to close the Bozeman
Trail and to abandon the forts. The Black
Hills were utterly forbidden to the white man,
and except for an agreement to let the Northern
Pacific rails cross the upper prairies unmolested,
the high plains from the Missouri
to the Big Horn were returned by federal
order to their historic isolation.</p>
<p>After that fiasco the situation remained comparatively
quiet for a few years. Eastern Dakota
was being settled bit by bit, and the rails
were pushing forward, ever so slowly but ever
so surely. The Missouri River was the frontier
line, dividing the settled Dakotas from the
Sioux lands; and Fort Lincoln, on the river
(not far from the site of today&rsquo;s Bismarck),
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
was the outpost that overlooked the troubled
territory.</p>
<p>From month to month trappers, gold-seekers,
and would-be homesteaders slipped inside
the Sioux curtain from the Cheyenne-Laramie
country on the south, from the rich Niobrara
country in northwest Nebraska, or from eastern
Dakota itself. There was not much that
the army could do about these treaty violators
except worry, for the borders to be patrolled
were vast and the forbidden lands inviting.</p>
<p>But the army did worry, endlessly. There
were increasingly frequent rumors of the existence
of gold in the Hills, and year after year
General Sheridan, commanding the Departments
of Dakota, the Platte, and the Missouri,
urged stronger fortification of the Sioux
boundaries to prevent trouble. Trouble was
particularly to be expected because several
bands of Sioux, specifically those under Sitting
Bull and Crazy Horse, had not agreed to government
supervision in 1868 and seemed thirsting
for a fight.</p>
<p>Thus it was to make a military survey that
Sheridan sent an expedition through the heart
of the Hills in 1874. His force of more than a
thousand soldiers moved under the command
of George Armstrong Custer; and, strange
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
impedimenta for an army, the luggage in the
lorries included mining picks and pans, the belongings
of H. N. Ross and William T. McKay,
who were officially attached to the
command. Presumably Custer was looking for
something more than mere military sites.</p>
<p>The Indian fighters of an earlier day&mdash;Kit
Carson, the Bents, or Sibley, for instance&mdash;would
have stood gaping in the stockade as
Custer&rsquo;s force moved leisurely onto the empty
Dakota prairies. This was no ragtag army in
buckskin, but an orderly procession of one
hundred and ten wagons, six ambulances, a
dozen caissons, and two heavy field pieces.
Each wagon and ambulance was drawn by a
sprightly hand of six sleek mules.</p>
<p>In addition, three hundred head of beef cattle
browsed slowly along the way in mooing
testimony that this expedition would live off
the very fattest of the land. The personnel included,
in addition to Custer&rsquo;s highly trained
troops, a hundred Indian scouts, a platoon of
expert white guides and trappers, and,
mounted upon docile mares, a special contingent
of botanists, geologists, geographers, and
assorted expert college professors. Also, as
has been reported, there were two miners.</p>
<p>To the north of the Hills, crossing the Belle
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
Fourche River first, the army made its gentle
way, and then down the west slope of the forbidding
mountains, seeking for an easy pass
into the dark interior. Tall in the saddle rode
golden-haired George Custer, for he was commanding
the strongest army ever put into Indian
country. It is little wonder that he slept
quietly at night, or that he wrote in his diary:
&ldquo;It is a strange sight to look back at the advancing
column of cavalry and behold the men
with beautiful bouquets in their hands while
their horses were decorated with wreathes of
flowers fit to crown a Queen of the May.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In that holiday mood the army moved down
inside the great bowl of mountains on its sightseeing
tour, and presently it camped about
three miles west of the present town of Custer.
All this while the miners had not been inactive,
but had plied their pans here and there as the
company passed across various streams. Until
this bivouac, though, they had had no luck,
and, as a matter of fact, had actually been
expecting none. They had come along to quell
the rumor of gold as much as to bear it out.
Preferably to quell it, if General Sheridan
were to have his way.</p>
<p>On August 2 of that year, 1874, McKay
turned out to try his implements once again
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
on French Creek. An early account gives this
dramatic version of the famed discovery:
&ldquo;When the earth [in the pan] was gone, he
held up his pan in the evening sun and found
the rim lined with nearly a hundred little particles
of gold. These he carried to General Custer,
whose head was almost turned at the
sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the magic of his discipline Custer
managed to keep his army from beating their
ration tins into placer pans and &ldquo;claiming&rdquo; on
the spot. Getting under way almost immediately,
the men continued their march eastward
through the heart of the Hills, and on August
30 emerged from the great park and headed
back to Fort Lincoln.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile a messenger had been sent
ahead with the news of gold. Scout Charley
Reynolds, who was to die with his commander
just two years later, was detached from the
base camp and sent scurrying down to Fort
Laramie, to the nearest telegraph station.
Within an hour of his arrival at the post, two
hundred miles to the south and west of the
Black Hills, the tremendous news was burning
over the wires to General Sheridan in St.
Louis.</p>
<p>It was also burning some operator&rsquo;s ear
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
along the way, for the great secret, which was
to be handed only to the high command in
Washington, made its way on that very day
into the editorial rooms of the old <i>Chicago
Inter-Ocean</i>&mdash;where, naturally, it was treated
with great respect and splashed across the
headlines with all the vigor of an announcement
of the Second Coming.</p>
<p>There was actually a genuine religious fervor
in the proclamation, for the locust had
been upon the land for many months in the
eastern cities, and the bread lines had been
growing. It had threatened to be a cold winter
until ... until this last bonanza burst upon the
nation.</p>
<p>Men had all but forgotten what a gold rush
was like. It had been so long since the last great
hegira to the Pikes Peak region that a new
generation had come into manhood, a generation
that knew California only as a state, Colorado
as a prosperous territory, and the Union
Pacific as the proper way to cross the empty
West. There were none of the desperate winter
marches up the Continental Divide this time,
no lost wagon trains on the salt deserts, no
Indian massacres. This rush left Chicago on
the &ldquo;cars,&rdquo; as noisy and as highhearted as fans
following a football club.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>And there was another great difference between
the foray to the Black Hills and the earlier
gold rushes. In this case the argonauts did
not get to the diggings. The troops saw to that.
Deploring the untimely leak of official intelligence
concerning the presence of the yellow
metal in the Dakota outcropping, the War
Department issued stern warnings to all settlers
to keep away. The existence of the treaty
with the Indians was proclaimed in every
paper&mdash;and, though less resoundingly, the danger
from the Indians was also mentioned.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, before the end of that crucial
year a sizable group of foolhardy settlers broke
through the blockade and made themselves at
home. Erecting a strong stockade at the scene
of the first strike, they soon carved themselves
a town in the wilderness, gratefully naming it
Custer, and even that early providing for the
wide main street where ox teams could make
a U-turn. Throughout the first winter these
illegal townspeople managed somehow to survive
the cold, the lack of rations, and the danger
of Indian attack; but late in the spring
General Crook&rsquo;s cavalry arrived to &ldquo;escort&rdquo;
them out of the Hills and back to the railroad
at Cheyenne.</p>
<p>Many of the citizens of that first town took
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
their eviction with fair grace, turning to other
means of employment than gold mining&mdash;and
there were plenty&mdash;in Cheyenne, Denver, and
the other near-by and rapidly growing settlements.
One group, though, the Gordon Party,
apparently enjoyed leadership of a tougher
sort. They refused to be intimidated by the
troops. Setting up camp on the very boundary
line between the forbidden country and the
permitted Platte Valley, they just waited. Actually,
an increasingly large number of immigrants
waited on the border only until
nightfall, and then set out into the unknown.
Some were apprehended by the cavalry and
returned, some were killed by the sullen tribesmen,
but hundreds of them managed to find
their way to the vicinity of French Creek.
More than that, they managed to stay.</p>
<p>It might be thought that gold mining, with
all its necessary paraphernalia, supplies, and
general confusion, could not very well be carried
on in an atmosphere suggesting the more
modern practice of moonshining; but the truth
of the matter was that there were just too
many settlers and too few soldiers. Time and
again the troops would swoop down on some
busy little gathering and hustle the miners out
to the nearest courts, where they would hastily
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
be acquitted and released to go back to their
workings. Under the very fist of forbiddance
a score of towns had sprung up, among them
the reborn Custer City.</p>
<p>Finally the government gave up all hope of
keeping the eager immigrants out of this last
frontier. By the fall of 1875 the border towns
of Sidney, Nebraska, Yankton, South Dakota,
and Cheyenne and Laramie, Wyoming, were
bursting at the seams with gold-hunters who
demanded &ldquo;their rights as citizens.&rdquo; Bowing
to the inevitable, the government sent a treaty
commission to wait upon the Sioux. This body
of earnest men offered the Indians six million
dollars for the right of entry into the Hills.
Although the treaty Sioux agreed to sell, the
price they asked wavered between twenty and
one hundred million. Crazy Horse, who did
not attend the council, refused to sell at any
price and solemnly warned the white man to
stay out.</p>
<p>Frustrated, the treaty commissioners returned
to Washington in despair, while the
embittered Sioux disappeared into the west
river country to nurse their grievances. Upon
this turn of affairs, the government washed its
hands of the matter and opened the lands to
settlement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>That was in June of 1875. Within a matter
of weeks after the bars had been let down, the
Hills were populated by uncounted thousands
of men, women, and children. Many simply
came out of the woods to claim honestly the
diggings they had been working dishonestly;
but many, many more came from the East by
every train, now that the country was legitimately
open.</p>
<p>It was a motley assembly that took part in
this Black Hills rush. In earlier bonanzas the
type had been pretty well formalized, for the
difficulty of the overland journey to California,
for example, or across to the Pikes Peak
region, had kept all but the roughest&mdash;and
toughest&mdash;at home. But on this occasion the
West was by no means as wild as it had been
in those earlier days. Distances had been conquered;
transportation methods, even beyond
the railroads, were much safer and more adequate;
and the Black Hills, although cold in
the middle of winter, offered none of the
climatic ferocities of the Rocky Mountains.
Thus, to partake of this feast of yellow dust
hopeful clerks brushed shoulders with desperadoes,
professional men of every accomplishment
traded rumors with crease-faced
sourdoughs from the dead land south of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
Mogollon, and oldsters who had thought they
might never again hold a pan in their hands
dug alongside mere boys from whom the apron
strings had been relaxed.</p>
<p>In the meantime, even as the good citizens of
Custer, Gayville, Central City, Golden Gate,
Anchor City, and a host of other thriving
towns, most of which have long been given
over to the ghosts, were bustling about their
exciting business, matters in the west were taking
a slow but inexorable turn for the worse.</p>
<p>The army had let the situation ride for the
summer and fall, keeping a careful watch over
the enemy Sioux, but feeling fairly assured
that they would attempt no large-scale raid of
the Hills, populated now by at least fifty thousand
people. Summer and fall were not normally
times to worry over, in any case, for the
buffalo were still on the range and forage was
plentiful for the tribes. It was in the depths
of winter that the tale would be told&mdash;either
the Indians would come docilely to the reservations
for their rations, or they would steer
clear of the white man&rsquo;s soldiers and supply
their own necessities by raiding the isolated
ranch and stage line outposts.</p>
<p>By mid-December the reservations were still
empty, and General Terry sent out a call to
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
Sitting Bull, ordering him to bring his people
in to the military posts. January 1, 1876, was
given as the deadline. The haughty Sioux chief
paid scant attention to Terry&rsquo;s order, replying
simply that the general knew where to find him
if he wanted to come for him. Sitting Bull
knew that the army would attempt no large
maneuvers with the weather as it was&mdash;one of
the bitterest winters in recorded history.</p>
<p>Then he simply waited.</p>
<p>But General Terry was no man to take a
short answer. Immediately he ordered three
expeditions to prepare themselves for the field,
to move as soon as weather should permit, and
to take the Indians early in the spring when
their ponies would still be thin and unrecovered
from the winter&rsquo;s rigors. General Crook
was to march north from Fort Fetterman, on
the North Platte River; General John Gibbon
was to move south and east from Fort Ellis, in
Montana; and General Custer was to come
west from Fort Lincoln.</p>
<p>Unfortunately not only the Indians but the
weather as well turned against General Terry,
for with the thermometer standing most of the
time at between twenty and forty below and
the prairie covered with the glaze of incessant
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
blizzards, neither Custer nor Gibbon was able
to move out of camp.</p>
<p>Crook, though, was able to best the winter
when March rolled in and to locate one of the
most dangerous of the rebel bands, Crazy
Horse&rsquo;s renegade Oglalas, deep in the Powder
River Valley. This was on March 17, 1876.
Had Crook&rsquo;s men not made certain grave errors
of tactics after a brilliant surprise, the battle
might have solved the problem. As it turned
out, the Indians galloped a few circles around
the troops and made merrily off into the forest.
Again the weather closed in.</p>
<p>Three months later, when the summer
weather made campaigning possible, Crook&rsquo;s
troops were able to take to the saddle again,
and again Crazy Horse was located, this time
encamped on the Tongue River, between Powder
River and Rosebud Creek. Again the battle
was inconclusive, for the troops seemed
unable to press the advantage of their surprise
discovery of the Indians.</p>
<p>Eight days later, on June 17, the bewildered
but indomitable Crook came a third time upon
Crazy Horse, now on Rosebud Creek. On this
occasion the troops were able to euchre the Indians
into a pitched battle&mdash;and were thereupon
so thoroughly trounced that Crook&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
command was essentially immobilized where
the bleeding remnant lay at the battle&rsquo;s close.</p>
<p>By the time the harassed cavalrymen had
bound up their wounds and remounted, Crazy
Horse had disappeared over the hills and down
into the Big Horn Basin, where his cohorts
joined a host of other bloodthirsty braves in a
great Sioux encampment. Black Moon was
there, Inkpaduta, Gall, and a major roster of
other courageous Indian warriors. Counseling
them and performing their good medicine was
none other than Sitting Bull himself, who, it
should be said, was not a warrior but a medicine
man and tribal diplomat.</p>
<p>Historians have never been able to agree
upon the number of braves assembled under
this battle flag, but all concur in the belief that
the camp could have contained no less than
three thousand warriors&mdash;in all probability the
greatest single Indian army ever to be put into
the field against the troops.</p>
<p>By this time other help was coming for
Crook, as he lay in the south nursing his ill
fortune. General Custer, having scouted out
Crazy Horse&rsquo;s retreat, had been ordered to
stop him from the north and to pinch the Indians
between the prongs of his force and
Crook&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>But it was Custer rather than Crazy Horse
or Sitting Bull who met the pincers. Coming
upon the headquarters village of the enemy,
Custer divided his force of 600 men into four
groups: Benteen with 140 odd, Reno with
about 125, McDougall with the ammunition
and supplies and perhaps 140 men, and Custer
himself retaining the balance.</p>
<p>While McDougall stayed to the rear, Benteen
was sent off on a fruitless errand into a
badly broken terrain to the southwest. Custer
and Reno in the meantime proceeded side by
side toward the village. Coming over the last
remaining hill before the Indian camp, Custer
dispatched Reno ahead to make a preliminary
contact with the enemy, while he rode off in a
somewhat parallel direction, apparently bent
on encircling the savages.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Reno did indeed encounter the
Indians, and when he realized how tragically
outnumbered he was, he immediately dismounted
his men to fight a delaying action on
foot, thereby saving both men and horses. He
obviously adopted this tactic on the theory that
he would be supported from the rear by Custer.
When he saw that Custer had decided to
make a diversionary attack on the right flank
of the enemy, Reno and his men gave up the
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
fight and concentrated on scrambling out of
the trap and making their way to the hill which
overlooked the village.</p>
<p>From that vantage point Custer and his
force could be seen across the Little Big Horn
at a distance of perhaps a thousand yards.
Apparently thinking that Reno was still successfully
engaging the Indians, Custer rode
his men down into a ravine where he apparently
encountered the full horde of savages
and where he met his death. The details of that
last action have never been made clear, but
most experts think that he divided his pitifully
weak force into two segments at the time of
the final charge which took him full into the
heart of the great enemy body. Thus it was
that Custer was caught in the pliers of the attack,
in which hopeless position his entire force
was wiped out to the last man, officer, and
guide. Custer&rsquo;s Last Stand, as it has been
poetically called, was in every respect the
greatest defeat of white forces in the history of
Indian warfare.</p>
<p>Custer&rsquo;s death marked the end of the Black
Hills controversy. Although the Indians had
been completely victorious, they had spent so
heavily of their warriors and their supplies
that they were never again able to mount a
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
major attack against the whites. Swiftly the
troops hunted them down, village by village,
and within a year the great Sioux War had
ground to a stop.</p>
<p>A second treaty commission had been appointed
late in 1876, and by February the
transfer of the Black Hills from the Sioux Nation
to the United States had been completed&mdash;not
for a cash consideration, but only for
the government&rsquo;s promise to support the Indians
until such time as they might learn, under
agency supervision, to provide for themselves.</p>
<p>By that time the question of entry was no
more than rhetorical. The Black Hills were as
thickly populated as any region of equal size
in the West. The stage routes in from Cheyenne,
from Sidney, Nebraska, and from the
Dakota railheads were well traveled. The last
frontier had been broken.</p>
<p>And besides&mdash;there was Deadwood and the
Homestake.</p>
<p>The original rush had centered in historic
Custer, the scene of the first entrance into the
country on French Creek, and the terminus
of the Cheyenne-Black Hills stage line. By
Christmas of 1875 the population of that wilderness
settlement was in excess of ten thousand
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
souls, each of them active and bustling
about his business.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there was not a great deal
of business to bustle after. French Creek was
a good clue to gold, but that was about all.
Before long most of the good citizens, having
found the little brook something of a snare
and a delusion, were casting about for some
way to make their livings from each other.
Storekeeping, laundering, ranching, hostlering,
all were honorable occupations which soon
found a plenitude of practitioners.</p>
<p>In that fashion the winter was passed. Ice
capped the waters and the snow hung from the
trees, and aside from hoping for spring there
was little the thronging populace could do.
Thus a fruitful field was in fallow for the gossip
which started blossoming in March and
April. The tales, whispered&mdash;as such stories
always are&mdash;without definition or authority,
had it that somewhere in the northern Hills
there was another stream that had nuggets the
size of ... it is unimportant how large the nuggets,
for a glitter of dust the size of an eye-speck
would have been a windfall in Custer.
Day by day the rumor grew, and as is always
the case with such gossip, the precise location
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
of this &ldquo;Deadtree Gulch&rdquo; was never made entirely
plain.</p>
<p>The reason for this obfuscation was simple:
a rich strike had actually been made far in the
north part of the Hills, and the claimants were
doing their level best to keep it a secret. The
fact that Custer held its population as long as
it did was a testament to the sagacity and close-lippedness
of John Pearson and Sam Blodgett,
who had stumbled, late the previous winter,
into one of the world&rsquo;s richest gold basins.</p>
<p>The secret held for only a few months. Trappers,
prospectors, and mere travelers were
passing through the spruce trails of the Hills
in such profusion that sooner or later the activity
up Deadwood Gulch, as it came to be
called, was bound to be observed. Pearson had
found his dream cache in December of 1875,
and he managed to contain the secret only until
March of 1876. Like a forest fire the news
of the strike to the north spread, and by May
the southern Hills were deserted. Custer, for
several years the metropolis of the entire region,
lost all except thirty of its citizens in a
matter of weeks, and other settlements in the
south and west simply dried up and disappeared.</p>
<p>That Deadwood Gulch, so named for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
stand of burned-over timber which graced its
declivitous sides, contained a major deposit
was not to be denied. The rich sands which
Pearson had spaded up testified to that, and
later comers were by no means disappointed.
But the names and locations of individual early
discoveries have long been lost to all save the
most assiduous researchers, for there was one
claim which outshone all the rest. That digging
was the mighty Homestake, which, from its
first days, has produced gold and assorted
other precious ores in such abundance and with
such dependability that it has been accepted
the world over as one of earth&rsquo;s great mines,
rivaled in munificence only by the Portland-Independence
of Cripple Creek in Colorado
and the fabulous workings of the Witwatersrand
of South Africa.</p>
<p>As with all rich diggings, an appropriate
legend attends the account of the original
discovery of the Homestake. It seems there
were two brothers, Fred and Moses Manuel,
who had long been addicted to that most
vicious of all unbreakable habits&mdash;gold prospecting.
Moses had wound his weary way
through the West for a full quarter of a century,
plodding the dusty California gold
gulches in &rsquo;50, up the steep heights of Virginia
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
City in &rsquo;60, into Old Mexico, and&mdash;although
he was a full generation too early&mdash;into
Alaska. But now, in 1875, he was through with
it all and was going home.</p>
<p>Collecting his brother Fred, who was fruitlessly
panning the sands of the Last Chance
Gulch in the high border country of Montana,
Moses started east, passing of course through
the Black Hills, to scout down this one last
ray of rumor&mdash;that a new strike was in the
making. Setting out their camp in Bobtail
Gulch, a mere pistol shot from certain placer
claims in Deadwood Gulch, they went to work
in midwinter, hoping to find, the legend has it,
just enough blossom rock to give them a stake
for their homeward journey.</p>
<p>They seem to have hit it with a vengeance,
not mere placer gold in the stream bed but a
genuine lode, for on April 9, 1876, they patented
the claim known as the Homestake. Discarding
for the moment all idea of going on
home with whatever meager wealth this &ldquo;last&rdquo;
try should bring them, the Manuel brothers
immediately consolidated their position by going
into partnership with another prospector
and taking shares in the Golden Terra, an adjoining
piece of real estate, the Old Abe, and
the Golden Star. The immediate returns, by
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
the ton, are not today known, but they must
have been substantial, for the lucky brothers
built an arrastra&mdash;a crude millstone affair for
grinding ore&mdash;and managed to pocket more
than five thousand dollars in their first year of
operation.</p>
<p>In the natural run of events the Homestake
and the adjoining parcels which the Manuel
brothers were operating would probably have
worked well enough for a year or so, and would
then have suffered the fate of thousands of
other diggings throughout the gold-rush West&mdash;the
surface ores would have played out, and
because of the high cost of following the lodes
deeper into the earth than a few dozen feet,
the mines would have been abandoned. But in
this case a San Francisco syndicate came into
the picture, providing the necessary capital
funds for the searching out of whatever ultimate
wealth the Homestake might have.</p>
<p>This syndicate of Pacific Coast businessmen
included James Ben Ali Haggin, a partner in
the highly solvent Wells Fargo express company,
and Senator George Hearst, the father
of the publisher, William Randolph Hearst.
These vigorous men sent a mining engineer
into the Hills in 1877 to canvass the location
for possible investments; and in the course of
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
a detailed examination of whatever properties
seemed to be paying well, this emissary from
Market Street came upon the brothers Manuel.
A superficial examination of the Homestake
and the Golden Terra sufficed this
engineer, and he optioned them both, the first
for seventy thousand dollars and the second
for half that sum. Returning immediately to
California, he delivered to his employers samples
of this richest gold mine in North America,
and without delay Senator Hearst went
to South Dakota to see for himself.</p>
<p>What he saw impressed him most favorably,
for upon his return to California he owned
both the Terra and the Homestake, as well as
several other claims on the same hill, a total of
ten acres of mining property. That small figure
is significant in the light of the fact that the
Homestake Mining Company today owns
more than six thousand acres of mining claims.</p>
<p>With the incorporation of the mining company
in San Francisco, the aboriginal methods
employed by the Manuel brothers were discarded,
and the latest in mine machinery was
laboriously shipped by train to Sidney, Nebraska,
and then by ox team the two hundred
miles to the town of Lead (pronounced
&ldquo;Leed&rdquo;), the precise location of the Homestake,
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
two miles from Deadwood City. The
first installation was an eighty-stamp mill,
which began its work in July of 1878. Within
five years six additional mills were in operation,
holding a total of 580 giant stampers.</p>
<p>The mine now handles four thousand tons
of ore per day and has, in its sighted reserve,
twenty million tons yet to work. The two main
shafts reach into the earth to a depth of more
than a mile, with branching tunnels piercing
the mountain at hundred-foot levels; and there
are more than a hundred and fifty miles of
secondary tunnels, served by more than eighty
miles of mine railway.</p>
<p>The richness of the Homestake ore has averaged
fourteen dollars per ton for many years
now. This may not sound like any considerable
amount of wealth&mdash;but the most active gold
operation in Colorado, the Fairplay dredge,
is working gravel which pays an average of
nine cents per ton.</p>
<p>Finally, the records of the company show
that it has mined 70,000,000 tons of ore, yielding
a total of 18,000,000 ounces of gold, which
has brought a gross price, at various standards,
of $450,000,000.</p>
<p>With the opening of the Homestake, the
conquest of the Black Hills was effectively
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
completed, and the region entered into a period
of rapid development and expansion. Although
the great mine at Lead was run solely
as a business enterprise, devoid of glamour and
excitement, the town of Deadwood, two miles
away, enjoyed a decade of the lustiest history
ever to be known by a bonanza town. During
its years of activity and arrogance Deadwood
contributed to our national folklore several
great figures, among them Calamity Jane,
Deadwood Dick, Wild Bill Hickok, and
Preacher Smith.</p>

</div>
<p>It has become the literary custom to recall
our bonanza frontier less as an economic
phenomenon than as a backdrop for bloodshed,
mayhem, and assorted turns of vigor and violence.
Early California, for example, is today
known less as the scene of the accomplishments
of James Fair, Charles Crocker, and Leland
Stanford than as the arena for the armed
forays of Joaquin Murietta, Black Bart, Dick
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
Fellows, and various other gunmen. Since this
is the accepted practice, it is entirely appropriate
to introduce the gold-rush days of the
Black Hills with a brief account of the banditry
and thuggery which accompanied the
early growth of that last frontier.</p>
<p>The quotation at the head of this chapter is
one verse of an old folk ballad, &ldquo;The Legend
of Sam Bass,&rdquo; the not particularly inspiring
saga of the life and death of an Indiana-born
horse thief and road agent. Actually, Bass had
little to do with the history of the Hills, and as
anybody knows who has ever whistled or sung
his song, the bulk of the chronicle concerns
his struggle against the Texas Rangers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Sam Bass will long live
in Black Hills history, for regardless of his
other accomplishments he went to his glory
bearing the credit for having originated the
fine art of stage robbery in that Dakota wilderness.
The Black Hills, like every other gold
region, enjoyed but scant holiday from the
pestiferous road agents. During 1875 and
1876, when the region was filling up, it seemed
that there was plenty to occupy the imagination
of every individual who was able to make
the tortuous trip from the railroad. But by
1877 the area had calmed down to such an
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
extent that idle hands could occasionally be
counted in the dram shops, and the time was
ripe for the devil to get in his work.</p>
<p>From the point of view of geography the
Hills presented ideal conditions for armed
assault. The two major stage lines leading
into the region were the Cheyenne-Black Hills
Line, running through two hundred miles of
desolate emptyland, and the Sidney Short
Route, less long by some thirty miles, but passing
through equally lonely country. In addition,
one freight and stage line came in from
the east, from Fort Pierre, and another from
the north, following the general heading of
Custer&rsquo;s 1874 expedition. The gold, though,
most often traveled the fastest route, out to
the Union Pacific at Cheyenne or Sidney.</p>
<p>During the first twenty months or so of the
Black Hills gold rush, armed guards were not
normally counted among the personnel of the
stage coaches. As a matter of fact, in most
instances it was to be questioned whether or not
any gold rode the stages, for the going was
generally thin in the diggings, and the average
operator accumulated his bullion for several
months before amassing a shipment large
enough to be worth the trouble and worry.
For all the wealth of the Homestake, the Hills
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
by no means repeated California&rsquo;s early history,
when every stage worth tying a horse to
carried at least some treasure. And yet, in the
springtime most of the miners cleaned up their
winter&rsquo;s take, it was commonly understood,
and ... well, Sam Bass must have thought,
every good thing must have a beginning.</p>
<p>In March, 1877, Bass organized a gang of
cutthroats in Deadwood, and the brief period
when one could ride the coaches in comparative
safety came to an end. It was not much
of a gang that the legendary bandit gathered
around him, the five other men being mostly
cowardly and quite worthless, either as adventurers
or as strategists. Bass himself was little
more than a &ldquo;punk,&rdquo; as he would be called today,
and, as a matter of fact, did not earn his
immortality until much later, in Texas, where
he was shot down in a barber chair by a
Ranger.</p>
<p>The gang, if they might so be called, foregathered
on the snowy night of March 25 in
Deadwood and, after consuming sufficient
whiskey to enable them to stand the cold, made
their way down the south road to a point a few
miles from town where they might intercept
the incoming stage from Cheyenne. What genius
of diabolical planning led them to attack
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
an inbound conveyance, which could be carrying
little more than ordinary mail, rather than
the &ldquo;down&rdquo; stage, which might possibly be
loaded with bullion, has never been figured out,
but at any rate they camped themselves in the
snow and waited.</p>
<p>At last the stage hove into sight, and Bass,
the trusty leader, cautioned his hoodlums not
to shoot, but merely to stop the coach and
demand the mail pouch. Presumably the sentiments
of the period held that robbery without
gunfire was quite condonable, and an entirely
different affair from burglary accompanied
by shooting. It is also quite possible that Bass
was only minding his own safety, for the night
had already been marked by one misfortune&mdash;one
of his men had managed to shoot himself in
the foot while putting on his deadly hardware.</p>
<p>As might be expected, however, Bass&rsquo;s well-laid
plans went very much agley. In the excitement
of calling &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; one of the bandits
proved a bit too eager-fingered, and even as
the stage driver was reining his team to a stop,
a shotgun blared out, emptying its charge at
close range into the driver&rsquo;s chest.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>With the shot the horses bolted, and shortly
thereafter they pounded into Deadwood,
guided by a hatless passenger who had managed
to secure the ribbons as they dangled.
Within a matter of minutes a posse had been
formed and riders were making their way into
the woods. Inasmuch as Bass and his companions
had been acting suspiciously during the
afternoon and evening, the finger of accusation
pointed altogether correctly in their direction,
and before the moon was down Sam Bass was
well on his way to Texas, escaping Deadwood&rsquo;s
justice only to go to his lathered doom.</p>
<p>This tragic foray against law and order set
the stage, so to speak, and before long the
spruce trails of the Black Hills, once so still
and harmless, could be passed over safely only
in the company of &ldquo;shotgun messengers,&rdquo; as
the armed attendants were called. It did not
take the stage companies long to come to this
way of operating, for Wells Fargo, which
contracted for the express business, had
had a quarter-century of rugged experience.
Bringing their brave talents swiftly to bear on
the situation, the Wells Fargo men steel-plated
the coaches to be used for bullion shipments,
and brought into the Hills the famed treasure
chests which had figured so largely in the history
of the coming of law and order to California&mdash;metal-bound
cases too heavy to be
transported quickly from the scene of crime,
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
and too sturdy to be opened except after arduous
work with chisels and crowbars. The chests
had been developed with the idea that a posse
could be gathered at the spot where a stage had
been held up before the gold could be removed
from the chest or the chest itself taken far
away.</p>
<p>A more important safety factor than the
chests was the reputation of the shotgun messengers.
The express companies went to great
lengths to engage only the most fearless and
law-abiding men they could find for this dangerous
task, and time and time again thousands
upon thousands of dollars in bullion rode across
the lonely trails with no more than one man,
his shotgun, and his reputation for bravery
guarding it.</p>
<p>Wyatt Earp, perhaps the most noted of
these messengers, entered his long tour of
Wells Fargo duty through that firm&rsquo;s Deadwood
office. Earp, as any lover of western
legend will tell, earned his vigorous reputation
as marshal in the bloody Kansas cattle towns
of Dodge City and Abilene. After the excitement
of these Gomorrahs had worn off, he
made his way to Deadwood in 1876&mdash;not as a
gold-seeker, but apparently merely in search
of honest and not too dangerous employment.
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
At any rate, his brief stay in the Hills was
given to the profession of coal and wood dispensing
rather than to law enforcement. Either
the weather or the lethargy of the place suited
him poorly, for within the year he was casting
about for some means of making his way back
to his own plains country.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the public clamor
against road agents after the Sam Bass affair,
he offered his services to the express agent and
was hired for the single trip out for fifty dollars
cash and free passage. The agent was by
no means doling out any charity in this exchange,
for he knew the value of Earp&rsquo;s reputation
and looked upon the fifty dollars as a
cheap form of insurance. He advertised in the
local newspaper: &ldquo;The Spring cleanup will
leave for Cheyenne on the regular stage at
7 <span class="small">AM</span> next Monday. Wyatt Earp of Dodge
will ride shotgun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bullion shippers were quick to take advantage
of this extra protection, and it was recorded
that no less than two hundred thousand
dollars in bullion was weighed in for that special
trip. It would be most dramatic to recount
that Earp&rsquo;s one trip was marked by attempted
mass raids, burning coaches, and wounded
drivers, but the truth of the matter is that the
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
journey was made on time and in good order.
Only one shot was fired, and that by Marshal
Earp, who took offense at the suspicious actions
of a rider whose course seemed to parallel
the stage route for an unaccountable distance.
Without stopping the stage or otherwise
alarming the passengers Earp dropped the offending
horseman a few miles out of Deadwood,
and the rest of the trip was made without
incident.</p>
<p>Despite the vigor with which the treasure
coaches were protected, armed robbery continued
to take place sporadically all during
the final decade before the rails pushed through
from the East. By and large these forays,
while bloody, were unsuccessful, and not a single
desperado was able to rise to any sort of
fame during that period. On the other hand,
there was one robbery which must go down in
history for the strange way in which the loot
was recovered.</p>
<p>This particular villainy, remembered as the
Canyon Springs robbery, took place on September
28, 1878. The locale of the outrage was
not far out of Deadwood on the rough way
through Beaver Creek and Jenney Stockade
into Wyoming and thence to Cheyenne. The
coach, on this fateful occasion, was rumored
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
to be carrying nearly one hundred thousand
dollars in ingots from the Homestake, as well
as from other works; and although shipments
of such size were not altogether rare, they were
sufficiently out of the ordinary to suggest the
services of additional shotgun messengers. It
may well have been the mere fact of the scheduling
of additional guards that called the
attention of the bandits to this particular manifest.</p>
<p>The holdup took place in midafternoon, as
the driver was stopping the coach to water the
horses. In the gunplay three men were killed,
and the bandits escaped with the loot from the
treasure chest, which they apparently managed
to chisel open. Ten miles away one of the
guards came upon a party of horsemen, who
returned to the scene of the carnage; but upon
their arrival they found the coach despoiled of
its gold.</p>
<p>In many such cases the bandits would have
been recognized as local or near-local citizens;
but in this instance all of the desperadoes appeared
to be strangers to the Hills, and consequently
the law officers had very little except
guesswork to guide them in their pursuit.
Guesswork coupled with just plain snooping
soon uncovered a trail, however, for one of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
stage agents turned up a ranch owner who
gave the information that a small group of
men had, on the very evening of the holdup,
bought a light spring wagon from him. Such a
transaction was unusual enough to indicate
that the purchasers were by no means individuals
of legitimate calling, and in all probability
were the actual bandits. Setting out on this
trail, the agent managed to trace them and
their wagon all the way to Cheyenne, where the
group had apparently turned to the east.</p>
<p>By that time persons who had seen them in
passing had recognized them, and their names
were broadcast to the marshals and sheriffs of
all the eastern regions of the plains. Day after
day the stage agent followed their trail east,
across the Missouri, across the border of Nebraska,
and on to the pleasant town of Atlantic,
in Iowa. By that time the wagon had been
discarded and the gang had broken up, and
the agent was following only one spoor&mdash;the
track of a young man who was always seen
with a strange, heavy pack on his back.</p>
<p>In the town of Atlantic the trail came to an
abrupt end, and indeed the mystery might
never have been solved had it not been for a
strange display in the street window of a local
bank. Pausing to see what it might be that
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
was engaging the attention of a crowd at the
window, the agent was astounded to behold
part of the very loot he was pursuing&mdash;two
bullion bricks stamped with serial numbers
which identified them beyond a doubt as part
of the Canyon Springs treasure.</p>
<p>Upon questioning, the banker proudly asserted
that his son had only the day before returned
from a successful adventure in the
Black Hills, and had, as a matter of fact, found
a gold mine, which he had sold for the very
bricks making up the exhibit.</p>
<p>Gently the agent disabused the banker of
this sad misapprehension, and, enlisting the
aid of the local Sheriff, had the prodigal son
arrested.</p>
<p>The unfortunate conclusion to this tale of
detective expertness is that although the gold
was eventually returned to the Homestake, the
young bandit escaped from the train which
was carrying him back to Cheyenne, and was
never thereafter apprehended. As for the other
four robbers and the rest of the treasure, no
further trace of either was ever discovered.</p>
<p>Although banditry and skulduggery played
a very great part in the tales of most of the
other bonanza gold fields, the Black Hills
story was for the most part happily without
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
extraordinary violence. Much more conspicuous
in the history of the Hills than the desperate
adventures of bandits are the exploits
of the folk heroes who rode the Deadwood legend
into immortality. Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity
Jane, Deadwood Dick, Preacher Smith,
all of these amazing personalities achieved a
lasting fame during the early days of this later
frontier, not for any deeds of derring-do in
the Sam Bass fashion, but for the old American
custom of living and dying in a high and
wide manner.</p>
<p>In all probability Deadwood Dick has carried
the saga of the Hills farther and to a
greater audience, both in this country and
abroad, than any of the others, and for that
reason, as well as for the strange circumstance
that he never existed, it is perhaps well to tell
his story first.</p>
<p>Dick, who never had a last name, was nothing
more nor less than the happy creation of
an overworked literary side-liner eking out a
living in the late seventies. Having exhausted
the possible plot complexities of such heroes
as Seth Jones and Duke Darrall, Messrs.
Beadle and Adams, proprietors of that stupendous
literary zoo, The Pocket Library
(published weekly at 98 William Street, New
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
York, price five cents), urged their hack, Edward
L. Wheeler, to crank out a new character.
This Shakespeare of the sensational,
having recently heard of the brave doings in
Deadwood, of the Black Hills, promptly created
a latter-day Leatherstocking, Deadwood
Dick.</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s success was instantaneous, for there
was a sense of truth in these stories which had
theretofore been missing. Dispatches in every
post brought the news of Deadwood as it was
happening, and thus the weekly appearance
of another Deadwood story was able to hang
itself firmly on the coattails of reality. In one
episode Dick courts Calamity Jane, who actually
existed at the time, and finally marries
her. In another, Our Hero is a frontier detective,
fighting bravely on the side of law and
order. In still another he has turned to robbery,
and at one point is actually strung by
his neck from a cottonwood gallows.</p>
<p>After exhausting the many plot possibilities
of the Black Hills, Dick, who had become as
real to his readers as George Washington, began
to work both backward and forward in
time and space. In one set of adventures he is
shown to be an active Indian fighter; in another
he turns up with Calamity Jane in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
town of Leadville, Colorado, which came into
its glory not long after the strike in Deadwood.</p>
<p>At last the many loose ends of the story so
entangled author Wheeler that he gave up
Deadwood Dick as a lost cause and out of nowhere
fetched him a son, Deadwood Dick, Jr.,
who marched on to the turn of the century
and down into our own time. Indeed, his noble
features can still occasionally be found staring
gravely up from a pile of old and dusty magazines
in attic corners.</p>
<p>With such a heritage it is little wonder that
as the town of Deadwood grew away from its
infancy, and as its modern Chamber of Commerce
turned to summer pageants as a source
of tourist interest, Deadwood Dick should be
revived and paraded. Deadwood&rsquo;s summer festivals,
the gay &ldquo;Days of &rsquo;76,&rdquo; are built around
a town-wide re-creation of the gold rush, with
the natives chin-whiskered, booted, and costumed
within an inch of their lives. During
this gusty week otherwise sober and retiring
citizens turn themselves out as stage coach
drivers, Indians, and pony express riders, and
the nights are filled with such a bubbling halloo
that the tourists, who come in ever larger
droves, are able to go home and report that
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
they have honestly spent time in a frontier
town.</p>
<p>To heighten the effect, the impresarios of
this gay divertissement many years ago decided
to raise Deadwood Dick from Beadle&rsquo;s
pages and put him on the street like all the
other self-respecting Calamity Janes and Wild
Bills. Locating an oldster who looked not unlike
the artist&rsquo;s original concept, they dressed
him in an assortment of western oddities and
gave him time off from his duties as a stable
hand while the festival was in session. For several
years this simple pretense was carried on,
and no sleep whatsoever was lost over the fact
that a mild fraud was being perpetrated on the
visiting Iowans.</p>
<p>In 1927, though, when South Dakota was
negotiating with Calvin Coolidge to get him
to spend his summer in the Hills, the stable
hand, whose name happened to be Dick Clarke,
was sent to Washington to extend a personal
welcome to the President. Patently a publicity
stunt, it fooled nobody but old Dick himself.
The rigors of the trip and the succession of
tongue-in-cheek honors heaped upon him somehow
tilted the old man&rsquo;s mind, and from that
day until his death a decade later he fully believed
that he was the original Deadwood Dick.
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
Frowning down any suggestions that he doff
his beaded finery and return to the care of the
oat bins, he betook himself far from the gentle
safety of the Deadwood that he knew and that
knew him, and took to touring the backwoods
with fifth-rate medicine shows and Wild West
pageants. Somewhere along the line he got up
a small pamphlet which he sold to the gawking
audiences who thought they were seeing a
genuine frontiersman. In this amazing tract
he spelled out such of the facts of Wheeler&rsquo;s
stories as were coherent and in logical time
sequence. The rest, including a date and place
of birth, he soberly filled in for himself.</p>
<p>And that was Deadwood Dick. When he
finally died, back in Deadwood in the early
forties, much of the town had come to believe
as he did that there had been a Deadwood Dick,
just as there had been a Calamity Jane, and
that this gaffer had been the very person. His
cortege was solemnly followed, and to this day
flowers are sprinkled on his grave by confused
but loyal residents of the Hills.</p>
<p class="tb">Wild Bill Hickok, on the other hand, actually
lived, and actually died exactly as the
legend goes, with aces and eights in his hand.
It was this unfortunate occurrence, as a matter
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
of fact, that gave to that particular poker hand
its gruesome name, Dead Man&rsquo;s Hand.</p>
<p>Somewhat in the manner of Deadwood Dick,
Wild Bill achieved a large part of his fame
through the earnest efforts of Beadle &amp; Adams.
That is to say, much of his renown came after
his untimely demise, and much of it was deliberately
generated to satisfy the great western-yearnings
of the avid book-buying public. In
addition to the publishers&rsquo; efforts on Bill&rsquo;s behalf,
great impetus was given to his posthumous
repute by Calamity Jane. Nevertheless,
in all probability Hickok was actually the fearless
and sterling character his legendeers have
depicted, and had he not been brutally done
to death by feckless Jack McCall he would
doubtless have earned even greater fame
through his own efforts in later years.</p>
<p>James Hickok was born into a farming family
in Illinois in the year 1837, and passed a
quiet and respectable boyhood in the ordinary
pursuits of such an existence. In his nineteenth
year he, like so many other young men of that
day, felt the urgent call of the Far West. He
hired himself out forthwith as a teamster in a
wagon train to the Pacific Coast.</p>
<p>Returning at the end of this one visit to the
golden shores, he managed to land in the Platte
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
Valley of the eastern Rockies in the very year
when gold was being discovered in that region.
The following two years he spent in odd jobs
around Denver and on the high plains to the
east of that new city. During all this time,
however, it seemed as if his heart were hungering
for the lower country. He let his drifting
carry him slowly back into Kansas where, at
the beginning of the Civil War, he managed a
station for Hinckley&rsquo;s Overland Express Company,
which was then staging from St. Joseph,
Missouri, to Denver and into Central City.</p>
<p>All these adventures gave ample opportunity
for any young man of spleen to entangle
himself a dozen times over in killings, brawls,
and assorted rough businesses, but through
this entire period James Hickok gave evidence
of being nothing but a stalwart and well-intentioned
individual.</p>
<p>The harmlessness of his pursuits, though,
came to an explosive end after one year in this
genial work, when he indulged in pistolry with
a certain McCanles gang. One version of the
Wild Bill legend states that the &ldquo;gang&rdquo; were
cutthroats, and that Hickok was only defending
his company&rsquo;s property. Another version,
equally trustworthy, has it that the McCanleses
were Confederate sympathizers, attempting
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
to raise a cavalry unit in the region and
thus offending Hickok with his Unionist leanings.
Whatever the reason, the outcome was
bloody. No one today knows for certain how
many men were killed, for eyewitness accounts
have included reports ranging all the way
from one to six, all of them presumably slain
by Hickok.</p>
<p>The doughty station manager, his helper,
and another stage company employee were
speedily brought to trial for the affair, and
just as speedily acquitted of any crime. Shortly
after that Hickok resigned his express company
affiliation and joined the Union army,
fighting the war out as a trusted though undistinguished
scout.</p>
<p>After his discharge in 1865, he seems to have
forsaken forever his once peaceful way of life,
and thereafter blood was more than occasionally
to be found upon his hands. His first postwar
killing took place in Springfield, Missouri,
in a duel with a gambler; and later that same
year he was reported to have mortally wounded
another card player in Julesburg, Colorado
Territory. In the next year another report,
unofficial like all the rest, had him killing three
more men in Missouri, and in 1867&mdash;this <i>was</i>
official&mdash;he went to the booming cow town of
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
Hays City, Kansas, where he was shortly offered
the post of marshal.</p>
<p>That his reputation, whether truthful or
legendary, was growing there can be no question.
By 1867 he was accounted to be one of
the best gunmen of his time and place, quite
possibly for the simple reason that he had survived
so many fights. For all the shadowy
overtones of his story, he was also reputed to
be a devotee of righteousness and order, although
this facet of his character may or may
not actually have existed. He was well known
to be a gambler, and his victims were all (except
the McCanleses) supposed to be cheaters
at cards. Whether his vivacity with Mr. Colt&rsquo;s
revolver was intended to rid the earth of dishonest
men or merely to avenge a lost hand is
beside the point, for his acceptance of the position
of marshal of Hays City indicates that
for a time, at least, his inclinations lay in the
direction of law and order.</p>
<p>From Hays City he went to a similar post
in Abilene, where he bore the star until 1872.
During all this time he was forced to kill but
a bare minimum of unworthy citizens, his ever
growing repute as a dangerous man with a
gun apparently frightening would-be desperadoes
out of his orbit. Three notches were all
that he placed upon his weapon during his service
in those two hell cities of the prairies&mdash;definitely
a world&rsquo;s record in reverse.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>Apparently the inactivity came to bore him,
for he soon gave up police work to return to
the army for two years as a scout. This harsh
calling also failed to satisfy whatever inner
wants were making themselves felt, and in
1874 he resigned to join a traveling show with
Buffalo Bill.</p>
<p>In 1875, however, he was to be found no
longer behind the chemical lights, but idling
his time away in Cheyenne. During this restless
interlude he married a circus rider named
Agnes Lake. Shortly after the ceremony,
which took place in 1876, he followed the trail
to Deadwood, arriving in April and setting up
camp with another ex-army scout. The motives
which drew him to that thriving boom town
were, in all probability, those which drew the
thousands of others&mdash;mere curiosity and the
hope that something might turn up. Indeed,
during the four months of his Deadwood hiatus
he did very little but play poker in the famed
saloon known as Number Ten. That he was
as accomplished a gambler as he was a gunman
was doubted by no one, and through his ability
with the pasteboards he apparently kept himself
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
in such funds as he needed. He did not
attempt to look for gold, nor did he seek any
official post in the town. He merely played the
long hours away at cards.</p>
<p>One might expect such a man as Wild Bill
Hickok to meet his nemesis in open battle with
a murderous cutthroat seeking to pay off an
old score. Western legend is filled with such
fitting come-uppances. But in this rare case
our hero was killed in a peaceful moment by a
total stranger and for reasons which nobody
was ever thereafter able to discern.</p>
<p>On the fateful day of August 2, 1876, he
entered Number Ten shortly after the lunch
hour to take up his everlasting hand of cards.
Normally, being a prudent man, he insisted on
a seat with its back to a wall, from which vantage
point he could keep his eye cocked for
trouble; but on this day, for some reason, he
arrived just too late to take his customary
position and had to accept a chair with its back
to the door. The game proceeded amiably
enough for a while, and there was nothing in
the afternoon air to suggest violence of any
sort. At last a normally inoffensive deadbeat,
one Jack McCall, turned from the bar where
he had been enjoying a quiet drink and, passing
the gaming table on his way to the door,
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
suddenly and without a word pulled his revolver
from his vest and put a shot through
Wild Bill&rsquo;s skull.</p>
<p>The effect was instantaneous. When the
news spread that Wild Bill had been killed, all
work stopped in the city and men streamed in
from every corner, expecting at the very least
to find a major battle in progress. When finally
the crowds were quieted down and it was
learned that the killing was nothing more than
a mere murder, the populace speedily hunted
up the terrified McCall, whom they found huddled
in a near-by stable, and arranged a formal
trial. The facts that Deadwood was at that
time still out of bounds to American citizens
and therefore under no legitimate civil jurisdiction
and that the judge, jury, and prosecuting
attorney were elected on the spot by a show
of hands, having therefore no official standing,
did not dampen the ardor of the crowd. A trial
was a trial, and its results would presumably
be fair and honest.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Jack McCall must have
been the most surprised individual of all at the
ultimate fairness of the legal machinery which
had been set up in his honor. With the acceptance
of his fumbling plea that Hickok had, at
a place unnamed and at a time unnamed, killed
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
his brother, McCall was acquitted and turned
free, and Wild Bill was sorrowfully buried by
the admiring populace.</p>
<p>As soon as he was freed, McCall hurried
back to Cheyenne to escape the reach of any of
Hickok&rsquo;s friends. Unfortunately the story of
the killing followed him there, and under the
mistaken impression that he had undergone a
legitimate trial and was therefore no longer
subject to additional jeopardy, McCall took
no pains to deny the murder. This was a most
foolish tactic on his part, for he was speedily
rearrested and shipped to Yankton, the capital
of South Dakota Territory, where he was held
for a session of the proper court. Inasmuch as
he had admitted before witnesses not only that
he had killed Wild Bill, but also that his earlier
plea had been fabricated from whole cloth, he
had a very slender defense indeed, and was
quickly found guilty and banged.</p>
<p>To the very end no clue could be found to
any sort of sound reason for his having fired
the fatal shot. It was quite definitely proved
that he had never had any dealings with his
victim and had never been in any way offended
by him, and that he no more than knew vaguely
who he was. It was apparently a completely
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
aimless killing, the unhappy inspiration of the
moment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Justice seems forever
determined to get to the bottom of the matter,
for <i>The Trial of Jack McCall</i> has become an
institution of the Black Hills, played, like <i>Ten
Nights in a Barroom</i>, all the summers long in
a popular tavern. Where audiences elsewhere
hiss their Legrees and other purely fictional
villains, the proud residents of Deadwood have
their very own and very real scoundrel for the
target of their malisons&mdash;the miserable McCall.
Tourists are cordially invited to join in
the fun and thereby to spread ever farther the
legend of Wild Bill Hickok.</p>
<p>On June 21, 1951, the legend was further
enhanced and improved upon by the presentation
to the city of Deadwood of a brand new
statue of Hickok carved out of a massive
chunk of native granite by the ebullient sculptor,
Ziolkowski. An all-day celebration attended
the unveiling of this statue upon its
pedestal at the foot of Mt. Moriah, and the
zenith of the day&rsquo;s gaudy reverence was the
reading of an &ldquo;epic&rdquo; poem to the hushed populace
of the town over a loud-speaker system
from the top of the mount. The statue is plain
to be seen about a block from the Adams Memorial
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
Museum, and copies of the epic can no
doubt be had by soliciting the Deadwood
Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p class="tb">Of a somewhat different character from
Wild Bill, but, it is good to report, no less
revered in the Hills, was Preacher Smith.</p>
<p>Frontier towns have been notorious for their
hallowing of persons, both male and female,
who were either expertly good or expertly
bad. This strange compounding of affections
would suggest that the vice or godliness in itself
was unimportant, but that the rough and
crude citizens who populated our earlier settlements
held a genuine admiration and regard
for anyone of any calling who demonstrated
authority and accomplishment.</p>
<p>And thus it was with the Reverend Henry
W. Smith. A man of exceptionally little luck
in life, he gave up his dwindling congregations
in the States and journeyed into the frontier
in 1875, partly because of a zeal in his heart
to bring the Word into the lawless and godless
gold camps, but also, it must be conjectured,
to find some form of weekday employment
which would enable him to care for his wife
and two daughters. The wolf had been howling
at many doors during those years, and parsonages
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
which carried even a bare subsistence
stipend were few and far between.</p>
<p>Smith went first to Custer, where he stayed
but a short while, finding little in the way of
work and less in the way of souls to save, since
the rush to Deadwood was then in full force.
Hiring onto a merchandise train as a cook&rsquo;s
helper, he made his way to that newer city, arriving
early in May of 1876. In a town of such
activity it was not difficult to locate work, and
shortly his hide began to fill out and his purse
to thicken. That purse, it was discovered after
his death, was to be used for the purpose of
bringing his family out to join him.</p>
<p>Working diligently and, of course, soberly
at his menial tasks from Monday through Saturday,
and bravely setting up his pulpit on
the main street on Sundays, Preacher Smith
soon won the respect and even the genial admiration
of the roisterous townspeople. At
first his congregations contained more wandering
dogs than people, but week after week, as
he determinedly kept after his work, an increasingly
large crowd gathered of a Sunday
morning to listen to his sermons.</p>
<p>Thus the entire town was shocked when he
was brutally killed by Indians while walking
to a near-by settlement to preach a sermon.
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
Indians were bad enough at best, but killing
a harmless and unarmed preacher was an act
of violence which shook the consciences of the
whole citizen body. It was on those consciences
that the guilt began to press&mdash;the guilt of the
knowledge that they had driven him to his
death by their slowness to accept him in their
own community and that he had gone to his
rendezvous seeking a congregation, no matter
how small, that would house him and the Master
he served.</p>
<p>Belatedly gathering to his support, the citizens
passed a sizable hat for the benefit of the
unfortunate man&rsquo;s widow and daughters. In
addition to the gift of cash, the woman received
an invitation to bring her grieving family to
the Hills, where care would be arranged for
them, including a teaching post for the eldest
daughter. Unfortunately, neither the widow
nor the daughters were in good enough health
to be able to make the rigorous trip, and in
consequence they could not avail themselves of
the hospitality and generosity which were so
late in coming.</p>
<p>Although they had failed to bring the parson&rsquo;s
family to Deadwood, the worthy citizens
were undaunted in their efforts to memorialize
this modest itinerant who had stumbled unwittingly
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
into glory. A great chunk of sandstone
was quarried and a local artist of more verve
than ability proceeded to hack out the parson&rsquo;s
likeness. The statue was eventually propped
over his grave atop Mount Moriah, the cemetery-museum
where he lies alongside Wild
Bill and Calamity Jane. Unfortunately souvenir
hunters carried on their unworthy custom
over the years, until finally the battered monument,
no longer even recognizable, collapsed.
In the Adams Memorial Hall of Deadwood,
however, there can be seen a certificate signed
in Preacher Smith&rsquo;s very writing, and thus his
handiwork lives along with his legend.</p>
<p class="tb">All stories of Deadwood in the Black Hills
come, eventually, to the great riddle of Martha
Jane Cannary (sometimes spelled Canary),
known as Calamity Jane.</p>
<p>This gusty female, who rolled around the
West for nearly half a century, has been the
subject of more controversy and speculation
than almost any other early-day character. In
her lifetime she circulated a brief autobiography
which successfully managed to hide the
truth about practically every aspect of her history.
In addition, she manipulated her drab
story in such a way that a whole generation of
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
legend-mongers accepted her as the &ldquo;true love&rdquo;
of Wild Bill Hickok, and thus by no means to
be thought of as the drunken harlot she most
certainly was.</p>
<p>By dint of careful searching, however, some
few definite facts of her early life and adventures
have been isolated, and upon them at least
the framework of her true story has been constructed.
She appears to have been born in the
neighborhood of 1850&mdash;add or subtract a year&mdash;in
Missouri. Some accounts have it that her
father was a Baptist minister, which is an unimportant
sidelight, for young Martha Jane
did not stay at home long enough for any such
influence to gnaw its way into her personality.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>How she managed to get from Missouri to
Wyoming while still in her early teens remains
a mystery, but nonetheless her career as a camp
follower started when, at the tender age of
fourteen, she arrived in the roaring outpost of
Rawlins. Some tales have it that she had gone
west as the consort of a young army lieutenant,
and that her mother, remarried to a pioneer,
found her in that boisterous military town and
took her to Utah. In any event she came back
into circulation two years later, for in 1866
she was duly married to one George White in
Cheyenne. Following this felicitous turn of affairs
she and her husband journeyed to Denver,
where he was able to support her in a fine, high
style. Unfortunately, she did not take to this
pleasant existence, but shortly began to yearn
after the cavalry. Leaving her husband to his
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
Denver duties, she appeared all during 1867
and 1868 in various forts throughout Wyoming.
It was at this particular time in her career
that she was supposed to have earned the
nickname of Calamity Jane. Undoubtedly the
title was bestowed upon her by barroom companions
who had learned the sad truth that
Martha Jane&rsquo;s appearance on the scene boded
a long and arduous night of drinking; but in
her maudlin and confused autobiography she
tells of assisting in an Indian fight and for her
splendid services being gratefully given the
name by a Captain Pat Egan. In a later interview
Egan denied this, claiming that the only
time he had ever seen the woman was while
escorting her out of a barracks so that the men
could get some sleep.</p>
<p>From Wyoming she went to Hays City,
Kansas, still following the Seventh Cavalry,
her chosen military unit. Six years later she
turned up again, this time disguised as a man
and marching with General Crook&rsquo;s police
force, which was trying to keep settlers out of
the Hills. Her autobiography claims that she
also accompanied Custer&rsquo;s command on its famous
exploratory march, but this does not appear
to be true.</p>
<p>After the discovery of gold in Deadwood,
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
she found the high life in that town so completely
to her liking that she made it her home
base. In time she fastened herself so securely
among the legends of the metropolis that she
was thereafter known solely as Calamity Jane
of Deadwood.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the high romance
which surrounded Wild Bill&rsquo;s name after his
death, Calamity made haste to pass the story
around that he had been her only true love;
and although there was no evidence of any
sort that he even knew who she was, her last
words, when she died in 1903, were a plea to
be buried next to him.</p>
<p>In the eighties she became restless again and
forsook her beloved Deadwood for two decades,
roving as far south as El Paso, and on
one occasion being seen in California. Her activities
at this time of her life are mostly lost
from sight, but it may be presumed that as
whatever charms she may earlier have had
faded, her interest to and in the soldiers waned.
During this period she married again, this
time wedding a man named Burke, to whom
she bore a daughter. She soon tired of Burke,
however, and drifted slowly north again, passing
considerable time in Colorado and then
returning briefly to Deadwood in 1895. Even
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
at that late date the citizens of the gold town
had not forgotten her, nor had the esteem in
which she had earlier been held dwindled;
when it was discovered that she lacked funds
to care for her daughter, the townspeople
passed the ever present hat and arranged for
the care of the child. This act of generosity was
purportedly to repay a great sacrifice which
Calamity Jane had made in the earlier days,
braving the dangers of the smallpox scourge
of 1878 to nurse whoever was ill and without
help. This particular legend has had wide currency
in the West, its closest variant being the
tale of Silver Heels, a dancing girl who visited
the mining camps of Colorado&rsquo;s South Park
in the sixties. Silver Heels is popularly supposed
to have ministered to the miners during
a similar plague, for which bravery a near-by
mountain was named for her.</p>
<p>After placing her child in a school, Calamity,
who was destitute, betook herself to the vaudeville
circuit. Inasmuch as through the dime
novels she had already become a well-known
national figure, she was able for a while to
draw large crowds. Had it not been for her
unfortunate habit of getting dead drunk before
show time, she might well have amassed a
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
competence over the years. But her first contract
was not renewed, and after a brief whirl
at the Buffalo Exposition she returned to the
West, spending the next several years in Montana.</p>
<p>At last she came home to Deadwood, a sick
and broken old roustabout. By this time she
was nothing more than a bar-fly, and she lived
out her last days panhandling food and liquor
money from strangers. At last, on August 2,
1903, she died of pneumonia.</p>
<p>Deadwood turned out in force for her funeral.
As she had requested, she was buried
near Wild Bill Hickok on Mount Moriah,
overlooking the town. That she had never
really known Wild Bill was quite beside the
point, and anyway, there was none present
who knew whether she had or not. The shoddy
story of her &ldquo;love&rdquo; for Hickok was nothing
that interested the old timers, but was saved
for historians to untangle. That she was no
more than an alcoholic old harlot was of no
consequence, either, to the good citizens, for
with her passing the last of the great names of
the frontier was coming home to rest. That the
townspeople were proud of her, and genuinely
so, was not to be denied, although there was
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
most certainly nobody present at that melancholy
service who could have told why. The
truth of the matter was that they were burying
not a broken old woman, but the last of the
Black Hills legends.</p>

<br />The White River Badlands</h2>
<p>Any visit to the Black Hills must also be
the occasion of a tour, at least for a few
hours, of the famous South Dakota Badlands.
This fantastic National Monument is not a
part of the Hills, either geographically or historically,
but because the two regions lie so
close together&mdash;a scant fifty miles apart&mdash;they
are expediently linked as two great natural
wonders in the same region.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;badlands&rdquo; has a loose scientific
acceptance, meaning any region where a specific
type of heavy erosion has taken place.
Such regions usually have subnormal rainfall
and sparse vegetation. Those rains that do
occur, then, find little on the earth&rsquo;s surface
to prevent almost complete runoff, which is so
vigorous as to act as a powerful cutting agent.
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
The final ingredients of a badlands are rock
formations known as unconsolidated&mdash;lacking
any general unity of structure which might
tend to withstand erosion. When all these conditions
exist, the devastation of the rushing
flood waters is without pattern, a great gash
being carved in one spot while no damage is
visible on a near-by outcropping. The end result
is an almost frightening collection of gruesome
stone monuments rising to the sky and
marking the heights once reached by a general
plateau.</p>
<p>Actually, much of the high western plain
abutting on the Rocky Mountains is basic badland
formation, and small pockets of distinct
erosion can be seen all through eastern Colorado,
western Nebraska, and eastern Wyoming,
in addition to the vast depression in the
valleys of the White and Cheyenne rivers in
South Dakota. This one region, though, sixty-five
miles long and five to fifteen miles wide,
is the largest and from the geologist&rsquo;s point
of view the most important of all such regions
in the world. Desolate, empty, seared by ages
of sun and wind, it is now a great gash in the
earth&rsquo;s flesh which exposes to view rock and
soil strata that measure a great span of earth&rsquo;s
history.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>In addition to the splendid opportunity to
see and study the various layers of the earth&rsquo;s
surface going back as far as sixty million years,
the very composition of badlands formations
makes any such region a veritable museum of
fossils and petrified animal relics. The South
Dakota Badlands have turned up absolute
treasures of such paleontological finds, enabling
scientists to trace the evolution of mammalian
life all the way back to the appearance
on earth of the first carnivorous animals&mdash;the
vastly distant ancestors of the dog. And the
Badlands are noted not only for the great
span in geologic time of their fossil beds, but
also for the number of different types which
have been found in their ancient soil, more
than 250 different prehistoric animals having
been discovered in various stages of fossilized
preservation in this general region.</p>
<p>The tourist, though, need not be even an
amateur student of geology or paleontology
to be thrilled and awed by a visit to this grotesque
but beautiful area. The mere colors
of the various rock strata, ever changing under
the light patterns of sun and cloud, provide a
never-to-be-forgotten experience. One of the
most articulate tributes to the grandeur of the
Badlands is that of Frank Lloyd Wright:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>Speaking of our trip to the South Dakota Badlands,
I&rsquo;ve been about the world a lot and pretty much over
our own country but I was totally unprepared for the
revelation called the Badlands. What I saw gave me an
indescribable sense of the mysterious otherwhere&mdash;a
distant architecture, ethereal, touched, only touched,
with a sense of Egyptian-Mayan drift and silhouette.
As we came closer, a templed realm definitely stood
ambient in the air before my astonished &ldquo;scene&rdquo;-loving
but &ldquo;scene&rdquo;-jaded gaze.</p>
<p>Yes, I say the aspects of the South Dakota Badlands
have more spiritual quality to impart to the mind of
America than anything else in it made by Man&rsquo;s God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word &ldquo;badlands,&rdquo; which now has a genuine
scientific meaning, was taken into our
vocabulary from the folk name for this very
region. In the earliest days of North American
exploration, far back before the Revolution,
French trappers had braved this empty
wasteland on their endless quest for new fur
grounds, and had brought back tales of this
lost world of silence and strange shapes. They
were the ones who gave it the name Badlands,
but they were only translating directly the
Sioux name, Mako Sika, which meant, precisely,
lands bad for traveling.</p>
<p>To the early explorers the badlands meant
only that&mdash;high escarpments to be overcome;
twisting, winding, endless canyons from which
there were no outlets; crumbling rock underfoot
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
on the three-hundred-foot crawls from
the canyon bottoms to the table-tops; and the
hot, shimmering distances of this forbidding
terrain as far as the eye could see.</p>
<p>It was, as a matter of fact, the existence of
this area that helped keep the Black Hills nothing
more than an empty question mark on
maps until the rumors of gold began to circulate.
The first American explorers, who
might have discovered the natural wonders of
the Hills in the 1820&rsquo;s, found their paths diverted
to the north and the south by this impassable
valley, and consequently missed the Hills.</p>
<p>The first reliable record of the wonders of
this lost world was dated 1847. That year, it
will be remembered, was one of great moment
in the history of the western movement&mdash;the
year that Brigham Young braved the high
prairies and pathless mountains with his great
exodus, settling an empire on the shores of
Great Salt Lake. Although the Pacific trails
were fairly well established by then, his was
the first of the true migrations, and the gold
rush to California, the Oregon excursions, and
the Pikes Peak mosaid were yet to come.</p>
<p>In this fateful year of 1847 a certain Professor
Hiram A. Prout of St. Louis came somehow
into contact with a representative of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
American Fur Company, which ran substantial
trapping operations all up the wide Missouri
and its tributaries. How this meeting
came about is lost to record, but we do know
that the fur trader gave Professor Prout a
souvenir of his recent travels through the Badlands
of Dakota&mdash;a fragment of the lower jaw
of a Titanothere, the first fossil ever to be quarried
out of the region and used for scientific
purposes.</p>
<p>In that same year a second Badlands fossil
turned up, this one a well-preserved head of an
ancestral camel, given to or purchased by the
great scholar, Dr. Joseph Leidy. With true
academic ardor both of these gentlemen, Leidy
and Prout, rushed their discoveries into scholarly
print, describing in learned journals the
nature of their trophies. Enjoying the slender
circulation of academic publication, the essays
which described these fossil wonders eventually
found their way into the offices of the government&rsquo;s
geological survey, which acted quickly
to dispatch an expedition to the overlooked
region of their origin.</p>
<p>That first exploring party, the David Owen
Survey, went into the field in 1849. A prominent
scientist-artist, Dr. John Evans, was attached
to the group, and from his pen we have
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
several sketches of this pioneer adventure into
the empty wastelands. If these drawings look
more like studies of Dante&rsquo;s Inferno than like
the breath-taking Badlands as they really are,
it must be remembered that such geological
formations had never before been visited by
the members of that party, and, being completely
alien to the America of their knowledge,
impressed them every bit as a visit to the
moon might have done.</p>
<p>The Owens party was merely the vanguard
of the great army of brave men and women
who have ever since made their dangerous ways
into the remotest distances of the mountain
and desert West, seeking neither riches of gold
nor riches of land, but only more minute bits
of the knowledge of the world of our past.
Archeologists, geologists, and paleontologists
from universities and learned societies the
world over have spent liberally of their time,
energies, and personal safety to scout out the
secrets of mankind&rsquo;s past in such remote corners
of the earth as the Badlands. Year after
year additional expeditions, both governmental
and privately organized, made their way into
this particular area, seeking out the fossil remains
which turned up in great numbers.</p>
<p>V. F. Hayden of the United States Geological
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
Survey was one of the most diligent of the
early explorers. He made trips into the Badlands
in 1853, 1855, 1857, and 1866, carrying
on detailed and exhaustive studies and eventually
unraveling the story of the region&rsquo;s
major geologic features.</p>
<p>As Hayden&rsquo;s reports became more and more
widely circulated, various universities found
projects of specific interest in one or another
phase of the work of uncovering fossil beds;
and from year to year Yale, Princeton, Amherst,
the universities of South Dakota and
Nebraska, and other institutions sent groups
into the Badlands for summer work. Gradually,
as these several groups exchanged information
and reports of progress, it became
possible for their scientists to trace back,
through the skeletal remains of prehistoric animals,
the very processes of the evolution of
many entire families in the animal kingdom.
Not only are the fossil beds of the Badlands
as richly stocked with remains as any such bed
in the world, but in a great many instances
entire groups of three, four, and five whole
skeletons have been found, making it possible
for museum workers to re-create almost perfectly
the animals as they existed and to set up
models of the terrain at various intervals
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
throughout its entire sixty-million-year history.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most noteworthy as well as
view-worthy section of the Badlands is Sheep
Mountain, located at the far west end of the
Monument. Down from the summit runs a
great canyon, the School of Mines Canyon,
named for the fact that the South Dakota
State School of Mines at Rapid City long ago
chose that location for the bulk of its paleontological
research. Under the guidance of
famed Dr. Cleophas O&rsquo;Harra, for many years
president of that institution, groups of Mines
students went on extended annual encampments
on Sheep Mountain, unearthing, among
other rarities, full skeletons of the prehistoric
midget horse, the saber-toothed tiger, and camels.
It was this last discovery that lent considerable
support to the concept, conjectural at
the time of Dr. O&rsquo;Harra&rsquo;s discoveries, that a
land bridge had once connected North America
and Asia, allowing the migration of peoples
and animals from the old world into the new.
School of Mines Canyon, while some distance
off the main highway leading from Pierre to
the Black Hills, is by all means worth the time
required to visit it. The canyon lies only thirteen
miles from the town of Scenic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>The Badlands are reached by Highway
14-16 and by State Route 40. Coming from
the west, from Rapid City, the visitor can take
route 40 directly to the town of Scenic, forty-seven
miles distant. From Scenic, in addition
to connecting with the side trip to Sheep
Mountain, 40 continues along the north wall
of the Badlands all the way to Cedar Pass and
out the east end of the region, merging at
Kadoka with Highway 16, or, by means of a
nine-mile connection, with 14.</p>
<p>Should the weather be bad and State 40 not
recommended by local informers, the route is
out of Rapid City on 14-16, east fifty-five
miles to the town of Wall, thence by the access
road through the Pinnacles, down into the
Badlands halfway between Scenic and Cedar
Pass, and joining State 40.</p>
<p>From the east, Highway 16 goes through
Kadoka, from which town State 40 should be
taken, leading in through Cedar Pass, and out
either through Scenic and on to Rapid City, or
at the Pinnacles, through Wall and back on
14-16. Coming from Pierre on 14, the tourist
must leave that highway a few miles beyond
the town of Philip and make the nine-mile detour
on 16 to Kadoka, from there going on to
Cedar Pass as described.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Several railroads serve the Badlands and its
general region, notably the Chicago &amp; Northwestern,
the Burlington, and the Chicago,
Milwaukee, and St. Paul. This last road, the
&ldquo;Milwaukee,&rdquo; offers the traveler the best view
of the region, winding up the White River
Valley the entire sixty-five miles between Kadoka
and Scenic, and providing the passenger
with unparalleled if hasty views of some of the
most rugged and isolated portions of all the
area.</p>

<h3 id="c9"><span class="large">THE BLACK HILLS</span>
<br /><span class="small">MID-CONTINENT RESORT</span></h3>
<p>From taboo Indian fastness to roaring gold
camp to modern resort and recreation area&mdash;so
runs the history of the Black Hills,
Paha Sapa of the Indians, which are really
not hills at all but mountains, the highest
east of the Rockies. Back through geologic
ages the story extends, to the thunderous
time when Nature fashioned the intricate
formations of the Hills and their companion
geologic marvel, the Badlands.</p>
<p>Here, in racy and fluent prose, Albert N.
Williams has brought the full sweep of this
story to life, from its beginning in the
mighty geologic upheaval that, before the
Alps had been formed, thrust the giant spire
of Harney Peak up through the ancient
shale, to the present quiet rest of man-made
Sylvan Lake, where it lies peacefully
reflecting its great granite shields for the
delight of the traveler.</p>
<p>On the way he tells of the discovery of
gold in this &ldquo;mysterious and brooding dark
mountain-land&rdquo; just when gold-hungry men
had decided that the bonanza days were
gone forever; of the Indian fighting that
reached its tragic climax at the Little Big
Horn; of the development of the Homestake,
one of earth&rsquo;s greatest mines; of the
hazardous stage-coach journeys on which
&ldquo;shotgun messengers&rdquo; guarded chests of
bullion; and, most fascinating of all, of the
amazing personalities&mdash;Sam Bass and Wyatt
Earp and Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity
Jane and Preacher Smith&mdash;who inhabited
the Hills in their gaudiest days or, like
Deadwood Dick, lived a no less vivid life in
the pages of dime novels.</p>
<p>If this were all, <i>The Black Hills</i> would
be a book for any lover of our country&rsquo;s
natural glories and thrilling history to pick
up and be unable to lay down again until he
had finished it. But other chapters directed
particularly to the tourist make it also a
book for the traveler to keep always with
him and to consult at every point in his
journey through the Black Hills. All he
needs to know is here&mdash;the highways to take
into the Hills, the towns with their historic
plays and celebrations, the peaks and lakes
and caves he will find, the sports he may enjoy,
the places where he may stay. A trip so
guided cannot fail to be filled with the excitement
the author himself has found in the
Black Hills, of which he says that in his
opinion &ldquo;no other resort area in the United
States possesses such a wealth of tourist attractions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Albert N. Williams was for many years a
writer for NBC in New York, and for two
years Editor-in-Chief of the English features
section of the Voice of America. He is
the author of <i>Listening</i>, <i>Rocky Mountain
Country</i>, <i>The Water and the Power</i>, and
numerous short fiction pieces in national
magazines. He is at present Director of Development
of the University of Denver.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
